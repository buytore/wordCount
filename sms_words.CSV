1718,13-01-07 8:50,B 1900D,Operations procedures,,Occurrence,Departure from CET2,High Risk,A VFR departure from CET2 climbing out on course through 9000 feet was told by edmonton centre on initial contact that CYR-221 airspace was active.  Advised them we would decend to 6500 feet immedietly to celar the airspace.Once celar of CYR-221 we climbed to flight planned altitude and continued on course.,"Was unable to find a NOTAM to see if CYR-221 airspace was active. Did not ask edmonton centre on the way into CET2 if the CYR-221 airspace was active. Decided to do a VFR departure instead of following the SID out of CET2 because of other aircraft inbound to CET2, and VFR weather conditions. CYR-221 airspace starts at 7000 feet and we climbed into the airspace, unaware it was active.","January 7 2013\r\nVern Lace-Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nQ/A Manager Flight ops to determine risk\r\n\r\n2013 01 07 21:23z.

Will re-enter.\r\n\r\nSpoke with both crew members to clarify that CYR airspace will only issue NOTAMs when the airspace is INactive, while CYA airspace must issue NOTAMs when airspace is ACtive (CAPS intentional). The investigation has determined that this is a single point failure and an HF related incident. \r\n\r\nFollowing the HF flow chart, it has been determined the following:\r\nInadvertent Error - Thinking Error - Rule Based Mistake. Poor application of a good rule. The crew mistakenly believed that there would be a NOTAM advising that the airspace was active, when in fact this airspace is always active. NOTAMs would only be used to declare the airspace inactive. \r\n\r\nIn review, the impact to safety management and the likelihood of reoccurrence is determined to be low.  This investigation has been reviewed and determined to be managed to As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP), and meets the SMS requirements for a root cause analysis.  The cause has been determined to be a human error and unintentional deviation from a single standard, procedure or process.  The individual was provided all appropriate training on these procedures, but failed to carry out the requirement of this single task.  My investigation has determined this decision was not affected by an external or environmental influence, which could have contributed to the decision made by the individual(s).  This situation as reported has not occurred within the framework of recent guidance and the originator has self-reported this deviation to record the event and to allow the organization to review for any possible improvement(s).   The report has been reviewed with the originator and they have been made aware of the significance or impacts of this event.\r\n\r\nInformation from NavCanada re the audio can be held on file, as it shows no discrepancy between the audio and the events as reported by the crew.\r\n\r\nNothing further required from flight ops.

1723,13-01-10 11:45,BE 100,Component Failure (or part of),,Occurrence,50NM north of CYEG ,Low Risk,"During Climb through 16500feet enroute to CYYE, I felt large yaw to the left and left engine sputtering ( surging). Looked at engine gauges and observed LH  ITT approx. 850-900 , LH torque 400ft lbs, LH fuel flow surging between 100-300 lbs/hr .  Called â€œmalfunction, max powerâ€.   We couldnâ€™t identify exactly what was happening to LH engine so I asked for Herman to reduce to power to decrease ITT to bring it below red line.  Once ITT was below red line the fuel flow stabilized at 200 lbs/hr and all other engine indications were stable/normal  for the reduced power setting (800ft lbs).  There were no other indications, all systems were working normally, and all engine anti-ice/anti-ice systems were on but not accumulating any ice.  While maintaining straight and level at 17000 and stable at 150kts,  I asked for Herman to increase power for troubleshooting.  As he increased power, through appox 1100 foot lbs of torque, all the same symptoms returned : LH  ITT approx. 850, LH torque 400ft lbs, LH fuel flow surging between 100-300 lbs/hr and engine sputtering. \r\nI immediately asked for Herman to bring it back to the reduced power setting.  I briefed Herman that we would maintain this power setting, closely monitor the engine gauges, and request with ATC that we return to CYEG due operational concerns- If the symptoms returned again we would consider an engine shut down and advise ATC at that time.  I was PF but passed control to Herman during descent to brief the passengers.  \r\nThe whole descent and approach was done with the reduced power setting and the symptoms did not re occur.

Now luckily I had just obtained 8 hrs of rest and was feeling fine to do it, however from OCC's perspective counting backwards from my check-in I need 1hr to drive to work and 1hr for personal hygiene I would have needed to go to sleep @ 21:30 on Tuesday to obtain my 8 hours of prone rest which would have given me 2.5hrs of sleep.

All obstacles are accounted for in the approach criteria\r\n\r\n-the governing factor for the circling minima is actually based on some higher terrain in the circling area and not by any of the towers (thus actually creating more altitude buffer from highest tower).  Minimum obstacle clearance is 300 feet above the highest obstacle or 500 feet whichever is higher.

I (Corey Young) decided to turn the fuel transfer on after both engines were started and taxi had been commenced from company apron.  After positioning to the holding bay at CYYC's Taxiway C (adjacent threshold Runway 34) for our first flight of the day system checks (note, location as per instruction from ground controller), Rupert (FO) noticed fuel venting from the underside of the outboard portion of the right-hand wing.  I immediately suspected this was related to the fuel transfer being on, and selected the transfer to off.  Approximately 10-20 seconds later, the fuel venting slowed and stopped completely.  A decision was made to proceed with the departure (fuel imbalance was within limits and fuel spill seemed minor).  Company dispatch was notified by radio and asked to notify the airport authority in case clean-up/recovery was required.  It was learned later in the day, following return to CYYC, that the airport's airside staff attended the scene and applied an absorbent product and contained/cleaned up the spill.  A YYC Airport Authority report spill report was completed by Flight Coordinator Farouk Nathoo and was to be sent back to the airport duty manager's office.\r\n\r\n~ C. Young","Not entirely sure, but I believe that an error may have been made (on my part) in choosing to transfer fuel with the intention of balancing the quantity in the aux tanks while the main tanks were full.  This may not be possible with the main tanks full.  In other words, the fuel transfer function may only be intended for the main tanks, and not for an imbalance in the aux tanks (to be researched).\r\n\r\n~ C.

1802,13-03-07 0:00,BE 100,Maintenance Procedure,,Occurrence,Maintenance,High Risk,"A time expired engine fire extinguisher cartridge was installed onto the airplane by the AME.  Task 132380-2.  It was in stores with a white tag in as removed condition with the date of manufacture written on the tag.  As per the KA100 maintenance schedule they are lifed from date of manufacture, and that life had expired while on the shelf.  SKA has now gone to Manitoba.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the p/n recorded by the AME on the task card for the part installed (13083-5) is different than the p/n written on the white tag (M13083-5), making it impossible for Records to know what p/n is actually installed now, and is also significant because the two different pn's can have different life limits.  (Should I make a separate SMS report for this?)","Lack of knowledge on the part of the AME about the expiry life of the part.\r\nLack of control in Stores for expiring part.\r\nControlling the expiry of this particular part happens to be very complicated because various aircraft types use the same part, but each maintenance schedule assigns it a different life.","March 11 2013-10;24-yxj\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nA task card has been requested by Q/A Maintenance to remove the TXd part and MEL the defect MEL26-02-1 and have the part replaced.\r\nHandling risk High-3-4 a time expired part was installed\r\nAssigned to N.

We checked the date of manufacture of the squib as 2007 and the life limit in the notes section of Winair said 10 year life limit so it appeared we were good to go. However some details were missed, this squib is used in many different aircraft and all have a different life limit, these limits are listed in the Maintenance manuals, the  KA100 has a 4 year in service life and maximum 2 year shelf life, the 1900 has a 6 year in service life and the Citation has a list of various PN's each with it's own life limit. We use a PMA'd replacement squib that has a manufacturer's life limit of 10 years, it is designated by the letter M in front of the part number. The number on the White tag had an M and I recall seeing PMA on the actual part. \r\nThe issue is our maintenance schedule's list the aircraft's maintenance manual as the governing document for the life limited components. If we want to change a schedule for a life limited component we have to have TC approval and documentation showing interchangability. This is all in the works and may be completed before SKA runs out of time on it's MEL. We added notes to the Notes section of Winair and checked off the life expiry boxes on all the part numbers of squibs in Winair. \r\n\r\nNick Gunn DOM April 03 2013 - The Beech Maintenance schedule W 0252 was amended on March 13 2013 to change the Life Limits to manufactures requirements.

In order to replace the drain the line from the main fuel transfer line inside the nacelle must be disconnected.  Due to the location of the line and the fuel pressure associated it is impossible to disconnect the line without being coated in fuel.  I replaced the drain valve and went to try and clean off the fuel from my body.  While starting the paperwork the aircraft was pulled out to be refueled.  This is when the screwdriver had been spotted by the crew and before my final leak check.  As soon as I was able I had to return home to shower and change my contaminated clothing due to the excessive amounts of fuel that soaked me while accomplishing the task.  I did not talk to the crew until after they returned from their day flying when I was informed about the screwdriver.\r\n\r\nNick Gunn DOM April 08 2013 - The screwdriver was most likely laid on top of the tire and fell into the position it was found when the aircraft was moved out side.

1805,13-03-14 17:45,BE 200,Training,,Occurrence,CYXJ NCA ramp,Medium Risk,During a medevac flight from CYYE to CYXJ the ambulance crew had difficulty in removing the patient from the aircraft.  \r\n\r\nThis flight was my first medevac with NCA as well as Dave Kellerâ€™s first ever medevac flight.  Maintenance configured FZVX with the lifeport system and gave Dave a brief explanation of how the system operated.  I was not present for this explanation as I was busy preparing for the flight. Upon arrival in CYYE the 2 medics had no problem loading the patient into the aircraft and the flight proceeded without incident back to CYXJ.  Upon arrival into CYXJ we waited in the aircraft to preserve heat while we waited for a second ambulance crew to assist in deplaneâ€™ing the patient as he was a large male.  Once the second crew arrived they proceeded to transfer the patient from the aircraft down the loading ramp for offloading.  Dave was assisting them from the inside and the 4 ambulance personnel were working from the outside.  They had the patient on the #9 stretcher (still attached to the PLUS) and halfway out of the aircraft.  I noticed they were struggling with unloading the patient from the PLUS and Dave asked for my assistance as I was still in the cockpit.  I observed that the #9 stretcher was free on our end in the aircraft but the medics had difficulty in lifting one corner of the stretcher from where it locks in the PLUS detents.  They finally managed to lift the corner enough to free the stretcher from the PLUS and slide the rest of the way down and onto their loading dollie.

He was speaking in a loud voice disturbing surrounding passengers. Jeff McColl was sitting beside him and due to this, asked to move seats. He was asked by both Flight Attendants multiple times to keep his voice down because we had passengers on board trying to sleep. He had an orange juice container that he was drinking out of throughout the flights that surrounding passengers as well as myself believe had alcohol in it. At one point in the flight John stood up to go to the bathroom and Flight Attendant MaryAnne stood up in order to assist him to the front of the plane, when asked by John what she was doing she told him that she was just going to make sure that he made it to the front of the plane alright to which he responded with, Back off. Upon exiting the bathroom he raised his voice telling us that he needed toilet paper, now disrupting passengers at the front of the aircraft. When he returned to his seat he asked me to please not call the RCMP and to confirm with the other Flight Attendant that she would not either. I proceeded to tell John that North Cariboo has a zero tolerance for drugs or alcohol, to which he said he is usually good on the flights and since he was heading home he wanted to have a 'good time' he told me this was the first time he has done this to which I responded that there is zero tolerance and even one time could cost him his job. He thanked me for my hospitality. The pilots were kept up to date on the situation as it occurred and between MaryAnne and myself we decided to let him remain on the plane for the YEG-YYC leg.

Martin assured me they will have their system back up and running by mid-August with Camco looking after the daily sampling and maintenance. NCA mitigates the risk of taking fuel from an unknown or poorly maintained sources by having the pilots ensure they have proper documentation of the daily inspection and filter change date from the site before taking fuel or completing the required daily inspection themselves and recording the filter change date on their log sheet. This is supplemented by audits when required or when an SMS report is submitted by pilots that something isnâ€™t right.\r\nWhat we are doing to fix the issue;\r\nâ€¢	The problems with the fuel system in Cigar Lake are being repaired/addressed, when we receive word that it is back up and running then we will complete an audit of the site with someone from Westwind present. \r\nâ€¢	The procedures for the pilots are in place in the form of a memo FOM 10-45, however the memo was three years old, Iâ€™ve recommended an updated memo be sent to the pilot group. \r\nâ€¢	The training for the pilots regarding taking fuel at remote locations was completed however there was no specific training on the Cigar Lake site (in principle they are all similar however the dry break on this system is backwards) and there was no mention of â€œIf the records are not on site and you cannot complete the required inspections to verify the fuel meets the minimum standard, then you must NOT take fuelâ€. This is stressed multiple other ways however that statement is not included in the training.

ZRX was parked next to the Dash on the blast wall. As I was standing in front of LWN a fuel truck pulled up in-front of ZRX to start fueling. I walked over to the operator and asked him if he would move as the D-8 was ready to go and the Ramp was already quite congested. His Reply was I'll only be 5 minutes and you have lots of room. \r\n\r\nOur East boeing spot was occupied at the time by another Dash-8. This doesn't cause an issue with clearance of any departing a/c until you put a fuel truck in front of a king air on the blast wall. I called another one of our guys to come out and wing walk the other side of LWN so we could get it out on time. \r\n\r\nWhile wing walking LWN out we had to let the wing of LWN over hang the fuel truck so it would not strike the wing of the Dash in the Boeing spot.  Even than it cleared the wing by a distance I would not normally be comfortable with. \r\n\r\nAfter LWN was clear I walked over to the fuel truck operator to get his name and truck number, when he asked why I needed his name and truck number I told him it was for the SMS report.

1840,13-04-18 13:00,DHC-8,Maintenance Procedure,,Occurrence,YEG ramp,Low Risk,During a routine maintenance start up of ODL's engine due to a pilot observed engine snag in flight (ref TC 132281-78) the engine power levers were retarded to the full aft position prior to engine start up.  Engine start up cycle commenced and the aircraft began to shake more than usual upon the completion of engine start up sequence.  Engine was shut down and it was then noted that the power levers were in full aft position which is full reverse with the prop lever still in feather.  Limitations on the gauges during operation were not noted to have been exceeded however a task card was raised to investigate this possibility.  (ref TC 132281-79)  ,"Allthough a start up checklist was used, both myself and Ben have not run a Dash is probably over two months mixed with fact that we have been doing a lot of engine rigging on the King Air's and 1900 lately.  With the Beechcraft, you verify that the engine power levers are retarded to the full aft position prior to engine start.  For some reason, this seemed to be the logical place for the power levers to be in prior to start on the Dash.

I jogged to the hangar door where I dumped my stuff I was carrying and ran outside waving to shut it down, they were already on the start sequence of the second engine. Apparently neither of them noticed the extra noise or different readings; they did notice the shaking but attributed it to the wind. As it was really cold and really noisy I didnâ€™t stay outside for long, after they shut down I went in to see what was wrong. After they fixed the problem and put the levers where they were supposed to be, they traded places as Andrew did not feel comfortable running the aircraft after the incident. They continued on with their maintenance runs while I investigated the problems associated with starting in max reverse. It should have been a simple call to Latitude to determine the torque produced on start; unfortunately Latitude did not get the information for that time period so we were forced to download the FDR information and send it to Ottawa to determine what the readings were. At 8pm we got the readings back and they were slightly higher then a normal start but did not exceed any limits. \r\nAndrew and Ben have both had training on the Dash 8 and are both checked out to run the aircraft, being that it had been a long time Andrew was going through the check sheet and for whatever reason determined the power levers at flight idle meant all the way back, a classic human factors slip. I briefed both about the importance of touching each thing in the check list and consciously noting the position. Andrew would like to clarify his comment about the King Air and 1900 levers being retarded to full aft meant to the gate, the Dash you have to lift a spring loaded lever to get over the gate, which is easier then lifting the knobs on a Beech aircraft, during this incident he assumes that he grabbed the levers and the knobs and pulled them all the way aft.

1856,13-04-26 9:00,DHC-8,Ground Servicing,,Occurrence,CYMM,Low Risk,"Flight 5100 to Cigar Lake with a Tech stop in Ft. Mcmurray\r\nAfter fueling at Executive Flight Centre in YMM we taxied down to the main terminal to the deicing bay. Once in position I witnessed deicing operations comence with the engines running. The bucket operator for Executive began deicing from the back of the wing spraying forward, This in heavy snow conditions (we were in very light snow and rain) can press snow and ice into areas that can impeed the movement of the control surfaces. The bucket operator was also in a position to not be able to see the leading edge of the wing to ensure that all the ice had been removed. As the deicing operation continued to the area behind the propellor there was no type 1 deice fluid that made it to the leading edge and thus left a slight amount of ice on the leading edge. Once the bucket operator switched over to type 4 fluid that also was not able to be sprayed in a way to coat the leading edge of the inboard section of the wing.\r\n\r\nThe areas that did not get treated are completely out of the view of the flight crew and thus the flight crew must rely completely on the deicing crew to do a proper job.I did not see any of the deice crew get out and do a leading edge inspection so I am assuming that the plane took off with out anyone looking at the leading edge other than what the flight crew could see.\r\n\r\nI was unable to attach a video and picture of this so will be forwarding them to Ken Pratt.\r\n","Cause of this was that the engines were left running during deicing. I know that Cariboo does have a procedure for HOT deicing, but has Executive Flight Centre trained there people in this method (do we have a copy of this training, and have they completed the Cariboo assigned training? Why were we doing hot deicing when we were in an aircraft that had an operational APU?

It was discovered after there was very little hydraulic fluid in the reservoir yet a, fluid check sign was posted in the plane before departure.  Also discovered, on the left engine, the solenoid was not properly attached creating a sense that there was a split in torque which activated the rudder boost.",Proper maintenance procedures in place were not followed or do not exist.,"James Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Aptr 30 2013 11:55 handling risk low assigned to manager.\r\n\r\nApril 30 2013-3;18 yxj local\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance.\r\nHandling risk MED 3-3\r\nAssigned to Ken Pratt\r\nAfter consulting the Base engineer changed to Maintenance procedure.\r\n\r\nMay 8 2013\r\nDeborah Kominko ACP 703/704\r\nSpoke with captain. Crew acted in accordance with all applicable guidance (SOP, QRH, AFM). Nothing further required from flight ops.\r\n\r\nQuestion - at this time, it is not required for pilots to check the hydraulic fluid level. This decision was made by maintenance. Do we want to revisit this, and train pilots on how to check the hydraulic fluid levels?\r\n\r\nKen Pratt May 14, 2013- NSV had just had the engine replaced and subsequent rigging completed, the aircraft had done the required test flight satisfactorily and came back to gather up the pilots they were taking to YYC. After the second take off they discovered the defects and returned. Their return was only due to the low Hydraulic annunciator. Since the aircraft only turned around due to the hydraulic fluid low light, Iâ€™m going to focus the investigation on that fact and the other defects are just that, defects that were rectified once we found out about them. For clarification; the issue with the solenoid or rigging was due to the bracket where the solenoid attaches to the beta feedback cable was twisted and not supported by the bearing that the solenoid rides on (supporting the weight of the solenoid) This was causing binding and the feeling like one side was not responding the same as the other, this defect is very difficult to determine on the ground due to the system functions normally when the test switch is selected but not engaging the same way or possibly the same rate side to side, while landing or taking off is where you would notice it. When the bearing seizes or the solenoid sticks will cause the same problem. The rudder boost problem was caused by the pressure manifold that the rudder boost pressure switch resides in, it is mounted on the LH engine reduction gearbox, when the new engine was installed we flushed all the oil out of all the manifolds and oil lines etc due to possible contamination from the previous engine making metal, when the manifold was reinstalled it was not bled completely causing a faulty reading by the rudder boost switch. This is also impossible to find on the ground. The manifold should be self bleeding (however slow?) but there is procedure to bleed it in the manual. With the Hydraulic fluid defect; I checked the task card and noted that the â€œCheck Hydraulic fluid levelâ€ task was signed off and the paperwork was completed per all â€œMaintenance Proceduresâ€ I interviewed the Engineer that signed off the task cards indicating that the Hydraulic fluid was checked, my investigation reveals a human error due to fatigue, pressure to get the job done, a miscommunication and a workaround for catching tasks that should be on the Routine inspection. This individual was given appropriate training and in fact had recently received Human Performance in Maintenance training from an outside vendor. The circumstances were such that we all wanted to do well and get the aircraft ready for Mondayâ€™s planned test flight. The Engineer in question pushed hard to get the aircraft done coming in at 9am, 3hrs early and working through to past the end of his shift to get the job completed. The Routine inspection task card has a note at the top that says â€œComplete Weekly inspection at same timeâ€ This weekly inspection is largely a duplicate of the Routine inspection and so human nature is to duplicate it by checking off that it was done since the Routine was done. When this individual was past his shift end time was when he discovered that the Weekly had not been done and so a comparison between the Routine check sheet which was done and the Weekly check sheet was completed by asking the apprentice if he did each item, he didnâ€™t come up with any glaring obvious things and the Weekly was signed for. I interviewed the apprentice and he remembers being asked about the hydraulic fluid however he thought the engineer was talking about the brake fluid, which he did check, there is a language barrier there that lead to poor communication. The Weekly was added to the Routine task by tech records as a workaround to catch things like the Hydraulic fluid check. Adding a weekly note onto the task card would normally work well if the person planning the tasks (me) had made a separate task card and printed the Weekly out and attached it to that task card however I didnâ€™t notice that statement at the top of the Routine task card. If the Engineer was well rested and thinking clearly he should have signed out the Routine and made a separate task for completing the Weekly in the morning however Human error become more pronounced after 17hrs at work and he made a bad decision. The unrealistic workload was put on them by me not appreciating their deficiencies as a crew, the individual here was trying to compensate by working extra to ensure his crew got the aircraft ready.\r\nThings we are doing to fix this problem;\r\nâ€¢	The individual that made the decision was counseled on proper procedures and we spoke about the procedure for working time guidelines out of the SMP.10-5. We spoke about the carry overâ€™s importance in me maintaining realistic expectations of the crews.\r\nâ€¢	Requested to Tech records that they add separate MCN for the specific tasks that they would like completed with the routine, this takes away the human factor of assuming that the Routine and Weekly are the same or similar.\r\nâ€¢	During our base safety stand down meeting on May 1st I spoke to the incident that clearly we were pushing to get the aircraft out on time. I stressed the importance of communication and being diligent in following through with every step (such as completing the weekly start to finish) no matter how it might mess up your day. I also spoke about operational pressures affecting our performance.\r\nâ€¢	Also during the meeting I apologized for not posting the Weekly inspection as this would have been a factor in it being missed until the last day of their shift.\r\nâ€¢	On May 2, I met with the engineers and apprentice on this shift individually and spoke about the cause and effect of these situations and their performance overall, I completed a review on each of them, there were other crew issues that may or may not have been casual factors in this investigation that are being dealt with separately. With each person we discussed communication as that seems to be a common thread with incidents that happen due to people rushing, for eg. If they communicated to OCC earlier that they may not have the aircraft ready then OCC has more time to find other solutions. I spoke to the number one priority of this company has been and always will be that safety comes first and if thereâ€™s things that are interfering with that then there needs to be a proactive SMS report about it and if it is not safety related then it needs to be documented on a carry over.\r\nMy investigation reveals a Situational Non-conformance error was made due to pressure and fatigue. We have worked to eliminate reasons to cut corners by one on one and group discussions and I have a better understanding of their efficiencies as a crew. I am recommending for closure.\r\n\r\nKen Pratt May 21/13- Assigned to Andrew Matson for HF maintenance sign off.\r\n\r\nRichelle Singer-SMS-June 27, 2013-1440L\r\nSMS Committee closed report on June 20, 2013\r\n\r\nFeb.3 2014\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maint.\r\nIhave reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found;\r\na.

1867,13-04-29 18:30,B 1900D,Operations procedures,,Occurrence,Vicinity of KEKPO waypoint; HOPE 1 STAR for CYXX,High Risk,"REF: CADORS #2013PO526\r\n\r\nNon-Revenue - Crew Only\r\n\r\nDuring descent along the HOPE 1 STAR into Abbotsford (CYXX) ATC issued us a command to 'climb immediately' at approximately 7800 - 7900 ft. ASL while we were in the vicinity of the KEKPO waypoint.  We initiated an immediate climb and were advised to level at 9000 ft.\r\n\r\nWe queried to verify we had been cleared to 7000 ft. after KEKPO and the reason for the climb instruction. ATC responded informing us we had received and accepted a clearance to descend to 7000 ft. cross KEKPO at 9000.  We acknowledged that we had received and understood that clearance and advised we had passed the KEKPO waypoint crossing it at 9000 ft.  The controller did not advise we were observed below 9000 ft. before KEPKO and no further explanation or comment was given.  In the next immediate communication we were advised to change frequencies to the next sector controller. \r\n\r\nUpon crossing KEKPO we were in a constant descent approximately 1700 - 2000 fpm.  The descent was not arrested at KEKPO as we were descending through 9000 ft. as we crossed the waypoint.\r\n\r\nClearly some issue I asked for a distance verification from TASDI (next waypoint) before switching to the new controller. We were told to standby while the present controller referenced the request. The controller advised roughly 10 - 15 seconds later that we were 7 NM from TASDI which was consistent with our navigation information. I initially remarked the discrepency had been explained, believing our distance showing to TASDI and from KEKPO did not match that published.  I shortly determined this was not correct and was a mental calculation error on my part.  The distance did in fact add up to that charted.\r\n\r\nThe HOPE 1 STAR was loaded from the GPS database (KLN90B) which was noted as expired.  The STAR waypoint information had been verified when loaded into the GPS flight plan prior to using it during the terminal procedure.  The KEKPO waypoint showed a small variation attributed to GPS rounding and was not concerning.  With the exception of passing through the odd scattered cloud, we had also been operating at all times in VFR conditions with reference to terrain.  We advised the controller of this during the climb instruction.\r\n\r\nAfter switching to the new controller no further comments were made and we continued in to Abbotsford via radar vectors.

After lift-off I left the landing gear down for about 20-30 seconds to blow the snow off the wheels.\r\n\r\nWe came in to land on RWY 11 in CYXJ.  On touch down, I noticed the airplane decelerated faster than the usual without use of beta/reverse.  I exited the runway on RWY 02 to clear the active and stopped the airplane.  At that point I was pretty sure the breaks were frozen. I contacted CYXJ radio to advise them of the situation and contacted maintenance to see what they wanted us to do.  \r\n\r\nWe ended up shutting the airplane down on the runway.  Our passengers were escorted back to the FBO by airport security.

I spoke with submitter regarding the practice of letting the Ramp-hands put the tape on as long as they let Maintenance know; this practice has become a â€˜Normâ€™ here and will not happen any longer. We held a safety meeting and discussed it as a group. A memo (see attached) has been posted in the Ramp room and Maintenance office, copy was sent to Ramp and Maintenance in YYC/YXJ. The procedures in the ramp manual will be updated in the next revision to clearly state that Crew lead will be responsible to determine if ramp/groomers will wash an aircraft due to the extra work that is required by Maintenance. In this event the Crew lead never found out until later in the night and was able to do the necessary work so there was no damage and maintenance procedures were partially followed. There was a miscommunication between the Ramp-hand who was intending to wash the aircraft and â€˜Maintenanceâ€™, as well a complacency or lack of understanding of the policy. In order to fix this we;\r\nâ€¢	Had a base meeting to discuss this and other reports, noted that common practice was to notify Maintenance when the flags were ready to come off\r\nâ€¢	Clarified that Ramp-hands must notify the Crew lead before they intend to wash an aircraft, not just a random maintenance person.\r\nâ€¢	Clarified that Maintenance is responsible to install and remove flagging and tape off the ports.\r\nâ€¢	Reinforced following policy and procedures and asking questions if they had any\r\nâ€¢	Issued a Memo to Ramp and Maintenance\r\nRecommended for closure.\r\n\r\nRichelle Singer-SMS-June 07,2013-1638L\r\nSMS Committee closed report on May 16, 2013\r\n\r\nFeb.3 2014\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maint.\r\nIhave reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found;\r\na.

All calls were made as required on 126.7 and the ATF for Pelican. \r\n2. The crew conducted the GPS approach, and got visual at the IAF. \r\n3. The captain was the PF.  He was checking out the condition of the runway as they approached, as they had been told that there was a 1/4 inch of snow on the runway. \r\n4. The crew made a radio call crossing the FAF on the ATF. There was no response. \r\n5. After passing the FAF, the crew spotted a black shape on the runway. They were trying to figure out what it was. When they realized it was moving, they conducted a go-around. In the overshoot, they realized it was a bobcat.\r\n6. The crew joined a visual circuit to return for landing.\r\n7. On downwind, the crew made a downwind call. They received an answer from the bobcat operator, stating he was making his way off the runway.\r\n8. The captain made another call, stating they would be landing in 2 minutes.\r\n9. As the crew turned final, they realized the bobcat was still on the runway. The crew made a final call, stating we're landing, get off the runway. The bobcat exited the runway to the side at this time.  About 20-30 seconds later (the crew estimates), they landed. \r\n\r\nThe crew tried all combinations of radios and frequencies, to make sure the problem wasn't with their radios. The only time they heard a response from the operator was when they were on downwind.\r\n\r\nThe captain spoke with the bobcat operator after landing. He stated that he had heard the static, but since he couldn't understand it, he didn't reply, or get off the runway.\r\n\r\nThe crew believed that from the bobcat's position at the time of the overshoot, there was sufficient time for the operator to clear the runway. One of the pilots on board is also a ramp hand, and has extensive experience with bobcats. \r\n\r\nBelow is the report received from the aerodrome operator:\r\n\r\nAt approximately 4:30 pm I received a call from the office to check on the airstrip as a pilot had some concerns they could hear on the radio but were not clear as to the nature of his transmissions.\r\n \r\nI went immediately to speak with Derrick and he explained that as he was removing the accumulated windrow from the mornings snow plowing when he heard the pilot calling that he was approaching and wished to land. Derrick responded that he was doing maintenance on the strip with a skid steer an would head for the parking apron immediately. He was aprox 3/4 of the way down the strip and left immediately for the parking area and the pilot flew over in a fly by and banked to come back around. when Derrick got about 300 feet from the parking apron the radio crackled twice in a static way and then he heard the pilot repeat three timesI'm landing,I'm landing, I'm landing Derrick looked behind him self and saw the plane descending with only 10 to 15 feet from touch down so he turned abruptly and drove off the runway and into the clear.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, there is a discrepancy between the two reports. At this point, it is not possible to determine what actually happened.\r\n\r\nMay 27 2013\r\nDeborah Kominko ACP 703/704\r\nMatter is being further investigated with John Green, VP Ops in coordination with the client.\r\n\r\nJune 3 2013\r\nDeborah Kominko ACP 703/704\r\nSafety Alert sent to all pilots.

In hindsight, they both believed that the incident occurred during landing at YQL, but was not noticed until YLB. Crew expedited exit from runway in YQL due to landing traffic behind them, and took the turn too fast. They both believed that this high speed exit caused the damage. However, in talking with maintenance, the damage as seen on the tires is a classic example of brakes being applied during landing. See attached pictures.\r\n\r\nBoth crew members have been counselled regarding the importance of ensuring compliance with the heels on the floor call. Both have already completed the tire and gear Aerostudies course. Neither crew member believed that they had their feet on the brakes. This SMS report will be used as part of ground school to demonstrate how easy it is to damage tires. See attached email to Manager, Training and Standards. \r\n\r\nThis is a human factors error, and falls into the category of Action Error - Slip. These â€˜skill-basedâ€™ errors occur if attention is diverted, even momentarily.  Resulting action is not intended: A simple, frequently-performed physical action goes wrong.\r\n\r\nIn review, the impact to safety management and the likelihood of reoccurrence is determined to be low.  This investigation has been reviewed and determined to be managed to As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP), and meets the SMS requirements for a root cause analysis.  The cause has been determined to be a human error and unintentional deviation from a single standard, procedure or process.  The individual was provided all appropriate training on these procedures, but failed to carry out the requirement of this single task.  My investigation has determined this decision was not affected by an external or environmental influence, which could have contributed to the decision made by the individual(s).  This situation as reported has not occurred within the framework of recent guidance and the originator has self-reported this deviation to record the event and to allow the organization to review for any possible improvement(s).   The report has been reviewed with the originator and they have been made aware of the significance or impacts of this event.\r\n\r\nNothing further required from flight ops.

Although the flight crew believe it may have happened in YQL, the extent of the damage should have been noticed by the flight crew on either the departure out of YQL, or the landing in YLB. \r\n\r\nA possible explanation is that the tire may have been damaged during the landing in YQL, but not enough to cause a flat tire. The subsequent landing in YLB then caused the remaining damage. In speaking with maintenance they have conveyed there were no other issues with the tire and the tire beside the skidded one had no damage.  The brake system was visually inspected and found to be working normally.  They also advised they have seen situations before where one tire is damaged and one is fine.\r\n\r\nNothing further required from flight ops.

1872,13-05-01 12:00,BE 200,Crew/Passenger Interference,,Occurrence,Fort McMurray,Low Risk,"YMM-YYC\r\n7 Passengers out of CYMM direct back to CYYC.  Alan went out to the aircraft ahead of the passengers and I came out behind the 6th, knowing there was one left in the terminal.  The aircraft was parked right outside of the doors so I thought it was fine that the ramp attendant would show him which aircraft to get on, and I didnâ€™t want the other 6 standing unattended on the ramp.  At the bottom of the stairs onto the plane, the 6 passengers stopped and formed two lines, like a gauntlet, facing each other.  I approached and asked what they were doing and that they should get on the airplane.  Someone said â€œItâ€™s Ryanâ€™s last day so letâ€™s make a line and pretend like we are going to high five him but instead pull out our _____ (insert male genitalia here)â€.   I said â€œletâ€™s not do that, keep it in your pants and get on the airplane pleaseâ€ and just then Ryan comes running and hollering out of the terminal towards us.  I turned to the others who were still standing there, one facing me with his â€˜partsâ€™ out of his pants, and three others had their backs to me, hunched over slightly with their hands in front of them, doing what I assumed was the same thing as the one I saw.   I said a few things like â€œare you kidding me? I donâ€™t want to see that, put it away and get on the airplaneâ€ etc.  They did, and when I got on a few of them apologized to me and I said â€œyou are lucky itâ€™s me and not a different woman in this company that might not be as tolerantâ€, one replied â€œwell I told you not to lookâ€.  I then attempted to give them a safety briefing.  This was difficult as they were a bit boisterous, and asked a lot of ridiculous questions about opening the door in flight, parachutes etc so it took a few attempts to get them to listen to me and get the briefing over with.  Once I was seated, Ryan got out of his seat to go slap another passenger in the face, and then sat back down.  Engines started, he got up again and started walking up and down the aisle like an FA handing out commissary.  He came up to the cockpit to offer us snacks and I told him to sit down and put his seatbelt on, as I had already told him.  Once he did, I turned and gave them another briefing â€œhere how this is going to go, youâ€™re going to sit down with seatbelts on and act like responsible adultsâ€¦etcâ€\r\nApproaching CYYC prior to 10,000â€™ we flew into turbulence, light to occasional moderate, so I turned to make sure seatbelts were on, they werenâ€™t, and it took several minutes and multiple requests to get them to put them all on with trays away and seats up.  Some of them were incredibly difficult, most likely intoxicated, as the cabin smelled of beer, and probably why they couldnâ€™t figure out how to get their seatbelts on and seats upright, and wouldnâ€™t stop talking enough for me to explain.  Finally they got seatbelts on, and on final approach up until short final someone (assuming Ryan) started hollering and cheering and making lots of noise from the back.  \r\nDeplaned in CYYC, when I got off the airplane Alan told them to show me more respect and listening to me when I tell them to do something etc.  Someone had tied another passengers shoes together on the flight, I am sure he tripped down the stairs.  He walked into the terminal with one shoe on and the other trailing behind him. \r\nOne elderly man apologized on their behalf for their behaviour. I should mention that there were two or three well behaved, silent guys that had nothing to do with the antics of the others and looked embarrassed. \r\nThe airplane was absolutely filthy with food and drinks spilled and crushed everywhere.\r\nAnother enjoyable Precision flight.

These passengers were not escorted out on the ramp by anyone, both myself and Rocio were not informed they were ready to board.  When I noticed that passengers were on the ramp I rushed out to see what was going on, and to escort the remaining passengers that still needed to board.  I went back inside to talk to the girls at the departure gate to ask them who let the passengers out on the ramp without an escort but nobody there seemed to know what was going on.\r\n\r\nNormally we are informed by an agent when the passengers are ready to board and we go over the the departure area and we walk these passengers out to the A/C.

1887,13-05-14 14:00,B 1900D,Maintenance (general),Third Party Actions ,Occurrence,YYC,Low Risk,"While conducting maintenance on the elevtor trim system, I saw that there was old masking tape on two panels on the top of the horizontal stab. Both panels 352DTR and 351DTL had masking tape surounding them as if to seal them, but the tape was old an peeling and flaking off. \r\n\r\nThere was no sealant on the panels. Somehow it was forgotton and not sealed up, and the tape was left in place. \r\n\r\nThe panel was secure and the screws were all tight. It was in no danger of departing the aircraft in flight. There was only tape surrounding the panel. ","The panel was at one time meant to get sealed up with PRC and had tape applied to the edges of the panel to help the sealant from getting everywhere. The panel was forgotton and the sealant never applied, and the tape was left in place. \r\n\r\nIt may have happened here, in Langley or even in Africa (though I doubt that). Our standard practice while doing this is to aattach a length of flagging tape to the panel so it is not forgotton. That must not have happened in this case.

The crew acted in what they believed to be the best course of action at the time, and took actions to mitigate the hazards presented as a result of their actions, however did knowingly contravene the regulation.

The security guard spoke to his manager and the outcome was because Braeden has a valid AEROMAG red pass he was allowed to be issued a visitor pass by the security guard for the evening and was to go to the pass office tomorrow morning and transfer over his red pass to NCA. \r\n\r\nSecurity warned us about the repercussions of not having valid passes while airside and to expect further ramp checks.

The rules state no employee without a pass is allowed to be on the ramp working. The base manager, Kayla and myself were called to a meeting with the head security manager for YEG airport and he was very upset, both girls left the office crying and without their red passes which were suspended until they (and I) completed the airport security course that they put on for every new red pass holder. I was told I could keep mine because I was at home during this incident and Braeden was excused because he was told to go out. When they called the primary contact on the NorthGate security plan, he told them to call me since we were not his employees, this created another issue since the YEG airport security people were unaware that NCA did not have a proper security plan. I rewrote the security plan and submitted it, then I rewrote the YEG security plan training aerostudies course to incorporate more warnings about going out on the ramp with no pass etc. I will be issuing the YEG security plan training course today. My investigation reflects the cause as a human error and unintentional deviation from standard procedures.

There is no regulatory infraction.  The CARS, and the security regulation does not state anywhere that a Red Pass is a legal requirement.  It is a requirement by the Edmonton Airport Authority to be on airside under contract with Northgate.  This does not, however, constitute a law; therefore there was no infraction of any law.  For example, a pilot on the Edmonton ramp who works for a company at a small airport, or a private pilot, does not have a red pass; however their pilots licence is their legal authority to be airside.  Regardless, the person involved DID have a Red Pass anyways, it just was not an NCA one; this was an issue of procedures, and not even a breach of any local CYEG ramp requirements.

I assigned the work thinking they would take the aircraft down to the far end run-up bays where we are to complete run-ups. After a while working in my office, Trevor Caswell from EFC arrived and asked me to come with him. The aircraft was run-up just outside the door. We spoke with the guys from JV-Driver who were not very happy, their Cessna Conquest was parked behind ODL. We downloaded the FDR data to determine the torque that the aircraft was producing since we all agreed that at idle there would be no way to pickup gravel and throw it at another aircraft. We were not able to determine why EFC had pulled JV-Driverâ€™s aircraft out behind a running aircraft. Because we canâ€™t control what EFC does, the focus of this investigation will be on how we can control and mitigate the risk of creating prop/jet blast on our tight ramp space. There have been communications/memos to the Maintenance crews here in YEG about running aircraft outside our facility over the last several years and the engineer that ran the aircraft knew the hazards. His belief was that because they were at idle and just above idle that there wouldnâ€™t be a problem. He thought he had dealt with the risk of upsetting anyone by going over and speaking with the guys who were on EFCâ€™s ramp and telling them about the plan to run the aircraft, the guys were working on a Cessna Citation at the time and were sort of off to the side not directly behind the aircraft, they were not EFC employees. The hangar door was closed and nothing appeared to be moving anywhere else on the ramp, it was a quiet Friday afternoon. The planning leading up to the run should have brought to light, the fact that they needed to view the tail during the runs which requires someone standing outside the aircraft during the runs. This was missed and all three people, the Engineer and two apprentices got into the aircraft. If they had a spotter outside the aircraft, things could have been very different because a spotter hopefully would have seen the EFC hangar door open and told them to shut down. There was no ramphand asked to come out and give them a GPU start and no ramphand saw the aircraft start and took the initiative to come out and spot the running aircraft. Basically they could not see anything behind them during the run. At some point during the run, EFC opened their hangar door (that an aircraft running on our ramp points directly at) and pulled JV-Driver out directly behind ODL and then pulled the Citation into the hangar. While the JV-Driver aircraft was sitting on the ramp ODL powered up to check the prop deice and since there was a bunch of pebbles left over from a filled crack that the airport had repaired, the pebbles were blown at the JV-Driver aircraft. EFC scrambled to move it out of the way but it was too late. The estimated distance was 120â€™ from the props of ODL to where the JV-Driver aircraft was parked. \r\nThere were several issues that were identified, again these are internal issues not related to EFCâ€™s actions;\r\nâ€¢	No internal SMP/current memo for aircraft run-ups, old memos not followed/relevant\r\nâ€¢	No training for run-ups\r\nâ€¢	Lack of knowledge about how much air the props were moving (prop blast) when above idle on a Dash 8.\r\nâ€¢	Lack of awareness about what was happening behind them during the run\r\no	Lack of communication to our ramp staff that a run was going to take place.\r\no	Missed step in planning that required a person outside viewing the tail during the run.\r\no	Missed FOD walk to identify the pebble material.\r\nWhat we are doing to fix the issues;\r\nâ€¢	Creating an SMP/memo specific to our operation.-Done\r\nâ€¢	Creating a training course-Done\r\nâ€¢	Create NCA specific run-up checklists- Done\r\nâ€¢	Send practical trainers to simulator training to train everyone else-In progress-Aug 8/13\r\nâ€¢	Wrote up contract of expectations for engineer involved-Done\r\nâ€¢	A meeting between EFC and NCA took place to ensure better communication in the future-Done\r\nâ€¢	Notified EIA of the pebbles which they gave us the spec for and told us they would clean up.( We had notified them in the past but it appears that they were either not cleaned or more had gathered since)\r\nRecommended for Closure with followup to ensure training complete by Sept 30/13\r\n\r\n\r\nRichelle Singer-SMS-August 27, 2013-1330L\r\nLong Term Corrective Actions completed (see attachment Long Term CAP Item Completion.pdf).\r\nSMS Committee closed report on August 15, 2013 pending financial loss added to report.\r\n\r\n\r\nRichelle Singer-SMS-November 19, 2013-1100L\r\nPer email from VP, Operations there has been no damage so far for this report.

1941,13-06-19 10:00,BE 200,Airframe,,Occurrence,On appproach to YBF,Medium Risk,"We were flying a visual approach for runway 08 YBF. I was the PF & Rick was the PM. I called for flaps approach. Once the flaps were selected, the gear warning horn started to sound. It was determined that this was happening as the flaps had inadvertently been selected to full instead of the requested approach setting. We immediately brought the flaps back to approach, selected the gear down & commenced the landing checks. We landed uneventfully on runway 08. We believe that the full flap speed was exceeded by approximately 25 kts.\r\n\r\n***I didn't add Rick to this report as Deborah suggested not to as Rick is now on vacation and I was unable to write this report with him.***",Accidental selection of full flap.,"James Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops June 20 2013 handling risk med 3-2; aircraft limitation exceeded.

The flaps stopped at approximately 20% (flaps approach is 35%). Seeing this, the PM moved the lever again, thinking it wasn't fully in the approach detent. This caused the flaps to move to full, exceeding the speed limit for flaps beyond approach. It was recognized immediately by the PM, and corrected. However, the flap speed was exceeded by approximately 25 knots.\r\n\r\nBoth crew members are aware of the importance of watching the flap gauge as the flaps move, to ensure they stop where selected. The PM was performing this duty when he noticed both that the flaps had stopped at 20%, and that they continued to full. The flaps should not be able to stop at the 20% setting, as they are not selectable between 0 and 35%. Maintenance inspected the aircraft and released it to service according to their task card, as above. This aircraft has no history of this problem, but the SMS reports will be monitored to see if this type of event re-occurs.\r\n\r\nCrew acted in accordance with all applicable guidance (QRH, AFM, SOP). \r\n\r\nA root cause analysis cannot be completed as this appears to be a failure of the flap system, and not a human error. \r\n\r\nNothing further required from flight ops.

We have had a meeting with ramphands to reiterate the message that if they need to stop an aircraft in the name of safety, then they can. In this case they could have left Flair sitting until EFC moved the helicopter. Due to another SMS report, Flair has also been instructed to use our company frequency to call-in and let them know when they are expected. In this case they had not called in and the ramphands dealing with the situation were sort of caught off-guard when it showed up and they realized a helicopter was parked in the way.

When another aircraft broke on arrival on Monday morning July 1st, we swapped NCF in place of the broken aircraft and since I was alone, I was trying to focus on the broken aircraft. The pilots brought me out to NCF while they were doing their walk around to look after an issue they were having. As I got back into the hangar and into the broken aircraft gear well, a pilot came and found me again and showed me the NCA003 sheet in the back of the log book that wasnâ€™t completed after clearing (and adding) a couple MELâ€™s over the weekend. So back to the office and I filled out the sheet, the pilot then left and I tried to get back to troubleshooting, as soon as I crawled on top of the aircraft to access a panel my phone rang, it was someone anxiously telling me that Canadian North had the wrong MELâ€™s applied to the aircraft and the flight plan was all messed up. I went to the computer and tried to get the MEL/CDL form to them as quickly as possible, in my haste I did not take the time to research the MELâ€™s from Winair, (at this point I didnâ€™t have the log book, the pilots were in the cockpit waiting), but thought I could complete it from memory. \r\nI was trying to focus on the broken aircraft and kept getting called away to help NCF and more stressed due to the fact I was alone and had a broken aircraft that required jacking and a hydraulic line that needed replacing but looked inaccessible without huge disassembly and down time. The line turned out to be quite easily accessible and the afternoon shift had arrived early. Over the weekend, the internet was down and so they had apparently contacted someone from Maintenance in YYC with the MEL status who was supposed to get it to Canadian North but that doesnâ€™t seem to have happened.

Aircraft NCF was having weight and balance issues which further complicated the situation; aircraft LSX was asked to hold until the issues with NCF were sorted out. Repeated requests were made to the aerodrome for an update on the situation as the temperature in the aircraft continued to rise.

Morgan Wright proceeded to start opening the forward left cabin door and the emergency slide inflated even though the door had been disarmed. Morgan kept a cool head and kicked the slide out the door before it had a chance to inflate inside the cabin where it could have caused injury or damage. I made an announcement for the passengers to remain seated, communicated with the flight attendants and Al Vittery contacted the CAL4 radio operator to advise them of the situation.  I disembarked the aircraft through the electrical bay to deflate the slide and a normal passenger unload was accomplished via the aircraft stairs.

Ashley has had the appropriate training and failed to carry out this single task as required. He was not affected by any outside pressures that could have affected his decisions. Iâ€™ve investigated this occurrence and determined that the likely hood of reoccurrence by this individual is low. A review of the Ramp manual showed poor grammar for the wording of when to insert chocks, it has never been a practice to insert them before the props stop however the manual was amended to reflect better wording and more clear guidance. This did not affect the individuals actions as he stated that he knew the props were supposed to be stopped prior to inserting the chocks. Amendment #4 was currently in progress.

I returned to the cabin and approached the two unruly passengers and asked them to collect their carry on and any other personal belongings and proceed to the front of the cabin. I then went to the back galley while this was being completed and discussed and filled in the 2RL Flight Attendant of what was going on and the procedure that needed to be taken. Once I opened the main cabin door, I escorted the two passengers outside of the plane where a ground agent was standing and waiting for us.

There were significant lines of thunderstorms enroute to YYC.  On take off the selection of the gear up was missed.  Through level off Ed called for the Flaps zero after landings.  I completed the after landing flow however didn't complete the checklist.  I diverted my attention to the weather radar because there were significant thunderstorms we would soon be deviating.  Through approximated 8000 I started to complete the After take off checklist.  I looked down and didn't notice the green lights however I didn't note the position of the handle. I completed the rest of the checklist satisfactory.  Aircraft reached speeds of about 170 -175 KIAS in cruise and possibly up to 205 KIAS in decent.  On approach into YYC, Ed called for the Gear down as per SOP, it was at this time I noticed the selector handle was already down and the gear locked lights were faintly on.  We completed the landing in YYC uneventful.  After shut down Ed asked flight attendants if they noticed the gear down.  Lynnsey said she noticed it was down through about 10000 feet but didn't think she needed to advise us.  Cale didn't notice anything. After the realization we flew all the way with the gear down, Ed figured out why the aircraft felt sluggish and doggy in the climb. We did have icing and updrafts and downdraft which was what Ed initially attributed the degraded performance to.

At this time it was noted that we were not tracking the fire bottles in Winair. The AD was completed on all the fire bottles and PN/SN was recorded for each bottle.\r\nTech records updated Winair and on July 24 the due list showed that 7 of the 9 bottles were past due for a 5 year light overhaul and 1 was due for a 10 full overhaul. 1 had been replaced so did not show up on the due list.\r\nAs these items were past due and after discussion with the DOM, Dave Williamson, we grounded the aircraft pending getting these bottles inspected.\r\nAt the same time tech records had included a copy of the spread sheet from Avmax which showed that many other items may be past due. Tech records looked into this and found a further 29 items that were not being tracked and were past due.\r\nAll over due items inspected and the aircraft was returned to service on July 27,2013.\r\n\r\nHerb Trussler\r\n\r\n\r\nDave Williamson 05, Aug. 2013\r\n\r\nTyler Kindermann's Statement\r\n\r\nGRNT was delivered from Avmax â€œClear for 1000 hrs / cyc â€“ 12 Months)   The initial plan (before the aircraft was delivered) was to operate the aircraft with a partial template built in Winair for short term planning and then build a more extensive template as the aircraft operated over the first couple of months.  Shortly after delivery of the aircraft the plan had changed from North Cariboo purchasing the aircraft to a short term lease.  At this time, due to workload, the decision was make to keep the aircraft on a limited template and focus the manpower on RJ template development.   When it became apparent that the lease was going to be extended past the initial limited build off the template I began in October 2012 to build in the next round of tasks into Winair to extend the due list until the C check due date in December 2013.  I unknowingly did not complete the task due to other â€œmore imminent and urgentâ€ work requests nor did I do a final check of the work.\r\n\r\nTo cleanly track the compliance of AD UK2012-0126 (X-ray of the engine fire bottles) we created the MCN for the AD and then began to built the complete fire bottles in Winair.  As Jeff was building / researching all the tracking points for the fire bottles he added some of the â€œvendor recommendationsâ€ to the template.  The last compliance information was entered making them show up as overdue in Winair.  It was this action of having fire bottles being on the due list looking like they were overdue that started the investigation, and the discovery of other tracking items being missed in the Winair template.\r\n\r\nNorth Cariboo and M-Plan Systems create a dummy / hidden MCN to record the initial manual status when a template is completely built to provide archival data.  What is now setup in Winair is a different MCM set to expire at the point when the no further accurate forecasting can be done due to the amount of data entered.

Secondary causation was due to the individuals involved being provided training which proved to be ineffective in this circumstance regarding this procedure.  A third latent cause, resulted from a lack of adequate overall supervision on an organizational level.  It has also been determined that the decisions made during the event were not affected by any external, or environmental influences, which could have contributed to the outcomes.  The Event Review Investigation is a separate Executive summary document not included in this report which was prepared for the Senior Leadership of North Cariboo Air.  \r\n\r\nI am satisfied this investigation has determined that all reasonable and required outcomes are, or will be taking place to manage ramp safety to the state of As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP).

There was nothing alerting us that it couldnâ€™t fly or had an open task card etc. the sheet said â€˜Serviceableâ€™.

I notified Herb and Tyler, and Herb then grounded the plane to have the W&B done.  \r\nWinair was tracking the 5 year interval on some of the 1900s, but not all.  The more recently acquired planes were not being tracked.  The Winair default interval was found to be set at zero. FNSN's W&B would have been due prior to North Cariboo operation, but was not included in the list of work for aircraft acceptance.","Confusion over whether the 5 year recurrence applied to the 1900.  I had thought it only applied to 705 aircraft and did not realize it was in the 1900D maintenance schedule (MSA PR-PG-088).  Therefore I did not flag it as a priority task when building the workscope at aircraft acceptance in 2012.  I don't know why Winair was set without the recurrence.

1999,13-08-06 8:25,DHC-8,Rejected take-off,,Occurrence,CYEG ,Medium Risk,"We were on runway 02 at B2. While Sean was advancing the power levers for take-off, during my scan I immediately noticed the control lock was engaged. I called reject and we rejected the takeoff. I advised ATC. Since we had only moved forward approximately 150 feet, after consultation with ATC, we elected to depart from our present position on the runway. I repeated a more thorough before-takeoff flow and checklist and reassured passengers over the PA. Following this, we departed without incident.","This was a human factors issue with myself that stems from a few months ago. Initially, I had perfomed the before takeoff flow in the order of the checklist (control lock, then condition levers). However, back in March I had noticed the flow according to SOP was condition levers first, then control lock, so this is what I began to do. While this took some getting used to, shortly there-after, all of my flying was from the left seat for the next two months. Since moving back into the right seat, it has taken some getting used to doing the before takeoff flow according to SOP again.  I believe today's incident is a result if this, combined with my own complacency of not visually checking items thoroughly while running the checklist after the flow.","Andrew Matson - SMS - Aug 6, 2013  1430L\r\nOn behalf of QA Flt Ops - Medium risk due to process failure.

2005,13-08-08 12:55,B 1900D,Rejected take-off,Cockpit Indication - On ground,Occurrence,Runway 34 at CYYC,Low Risk,"Shortly after commencing the take-off roll from Calgaryâ€™s Runway 34, the Master Warning (red) light illuminated with an accompanying RH AC Bus Fail annunciator light illuminating briefly as well.  I, Corey Young (PF & Captain), called for the reject and simultaneously pulled engine power to idle.  Russell (PM & FO) advised tower of the reject.  We were then instructed to exit the runway to the right onto Runway 08.  Note that the RH AC Bus Fail light extinguished on its own at about the time that I pulled power back (i.e., the light was only illuminated for approximately two-three seconds).\r\n\r\nOnce clear of the active runway, taxi clearance was requested to Holding Bay Mike where I performed an engine power run to approximately 3200 ft. lbs. of torque to see if the snag would duplicate.  There was no further illumination of the light during this run.\r\n\r\nCalgary maintenance was then consulted via radio for their thoughts and guidance.  During this consultation, the Master Warning light illuminated again (once only, and at idle power), but neither pilot observed the illumination of any red annunciator light that would have triggered the Master Warning.  A very brief illumination of the RH AC Bus Fail annunciator light was suspected.  After consideration by maintenance of the overall situation including a similar occurrence being documented in the aircraft journey logbook previously (18-Jul-13), they made the call to have the aircraft return to Apron 5 for investigation.

At approximately 8000â€™ we encountered light icing conditions. Climbing through 14000â€™ the RH windshield outer pane cracked. Erich immediately asked me to check if the inner pane was cracked, it was not. I requested to level off with ATC and advised that them we had an abnormal procedure and to standby, ATC responded giving us a heading and altitude of 15000â€™. Erich levelled off at 15000â€™ and completed the emergency checklist, checked weather (it was just above minimums) at CYYC and decided to return back. I talked to OCC and advised we would be returning due to the RH windshield being cracked, I then told the passengers we would be returning to Calgary. While I was briefing the passengers Erich asked ATC for an approach back to CYYC, ATC assigned us radar vectors for the ILS 16. We were still flying at 15000â€™ and ice levels had now increased to be moderate/ heavy, we blew the boots and ATC then started our descent. Erich asked for the avionics for the ILS 16 and as we completed the avionics for ILS 16 ATC changed Runways and advised we would be on the ILS 10.

2008,13-08-10 15:45,BE 200,Overshoot (go-around),Control Difficulties,Occurrence,ILS 29 CYXJ at minimums +50',Low Risk,"During the ILS appch to runway 29 in CYXJ the appch became unstable due to both localizer and glideslop deviations as we approached minimums. As CGM has no auto-pilot or flight director, this was a raw data, hand flown appch. At approximately 50' above ILS minimums the glideslope and localizer needles deflected past acceptable tolerances.  At that point we had verticle ground contact but no runway markings or lights in sight, so I called for a go-around. The go-around was executed as per SOPs. During the initial phase of the go around the aircraft settled another 50' before a positive rate was achieved. At this point I was able to see the runway clearly, however the go-around procedure had already been commenced so we continued to fly the published missed approached procedure. I determined that if we had been stable at ILS minimums that a successful landing would likely have been possible, so we requested clearance for a second approach. We had anticipated possible foggy conditions and carried contingency fuel to allow extra approaches/holding time. Once level at 6000' and on vectors for the second approach I took control from Mark and became PM for the duration of the leg. The second appch was successful with runway lights visible at minimums +50'.","The appch became unstable as we neared minimums. Other than sim training, Mark had not had the opportunity to hand-fly and appch to ILS minimums before and as such was just a little too slow to correct the localizer and glideslope deviations on short final. As soon as I called for the go-around Mark executed it as per SOPs. Safety of the aircraft was never compromised and Mark maintained control of the a/c throughout the procedure. We had been given several weather updates as we neared CYXJ and changed our planned appch from a visual to PMA, then from a PMA to a standard ILS. This coincided with the weather reports which were initially VFR, then briefly dropped to RVR 1400  and then quickly increased to RVR +6000 with an increasing ceiling. No further reports were received after RVR +6000 so at that point we did not anticipate having to continue all the way to minimums to achieve runway contact.","Andrew Matson - SMS - Aug 12, 2013  0930L\r\nOn behalf of QA Maintenance.

2012,13-08-08 11:00,B 1900D,Baggage- Loading /  Unloading,,Occurrence,CYYC Ramp,Medium Risk,"The aircraft was positioned on the ramp with the rear cargo door overhanging the soft/damp grass (it had rained the night before).  I climbed up the short ladder which required me stepping on the top step, which is not recommended by the manufacturer.  The next thing I knew, the ladder became unstable causing me to fall.  My lower body fell on top of the ladder, and upper body hit the ground.\r\n\r\nThere was an Executive Flight Centre employee fueling the left aux tank at the time, in direct sight of the fall and saw the whole thing.  He said that as I climbed up the ladder, one of the legs sunk into the ground causing the ladder to become unevenly footed which is when I fell.  He also said that my head came within about 6â€ of hitting the pavement.\r\n\r\nOnce I got up, I noticed that the ladder had broken at one of the rivets attaching a folding cross-member support.  I suspect the ladder broke when I fell on top of it however, it is possible that it broke when the load became uneven which contributed to my fall.\r\n","One contributing cause would be that the aircraft was positioned with the baggage area overhanging the grass.  In this case I believe it was unnecessary because it was 11am local time, and there was lots of space on the ramp for the aircraft to be completely on pavement.\r\n\r\nAnother contributing cause would be not following the ladder manufacturerâ€™s â€œNO STEPâ€ rule for the top step.  Unfortunately in order to get into the cargo area, it is necessary to do so on the shorter ladders.  Some of the aircraft have the slightly taller ladders which do not require stepping on the top step - perhaps appropriately sized ladders, which wouldn't require personnel to ignore the ladder manufacturer's rules, should be used for all aircraft.","Andrew Matson - SMS - Aug 14, 2013 1315L\r\nOn behalf of QA Maintenance.

The RH airspeed indicator in DFT was recently replaced. When I went to go troubleshoot the snag, I found taht the unit they replaced it with was the same part number as the unit removed and the correct part number as per the IPC, but the markings on the face for the speeds and the barber pole were different and not applicable to this aircraft. The markings on the face were not verified and checked to see if they are applicable to this aircraft. King Air 200s have all kinds of mods that effect the airspeeds, so often it is common to modify the painting on the face of the gauge, so you get instruments with different speed markings, but the same part number. There is no official system of tracking the different markings with different part numbers. it must be verified visually each time you change/replace an airspeed indicator.",I think one of the causes was the installer not being aware that the same part number airspeed indicator can have different markings.,"August 29 8;30 am yxj\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager Maintenance\r\nChanged to occurrence\r\nHandling risk medium 3-3 due wrong part number installed on aircraft\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Aug 29 2013 10:15AM handling risk med 3-3 per QA maint.

Ramp agents were advised of this and I did not see motivation to ensure that this was being done quickly and efficiently . As the pax asked me what the delay was I went on stairs and jokingly with laughter asked them to hurry .One of the ramp agents smiled back and in no way did he go at any faster or slower of pace then what I had previously seen. \r\nAround 5 min later I saw a ramp agent bend down by prop and hit his head on prop . I noticed he did not grab his head after the impact to check for blood or apply pressure he walked towards the side of ramp and stood there . His actions led me to believe he wasnt hurt . I would have been more than willing to assist . \r\nA man who I believe was supervisor asked if I was rushing him . I told him that yes I had asked the ramp agents to hurry and when I did it was minutes between when the incident happened and I didnt notice a change of pace .

In the quantity and type of packaging section, it indicates 3L of toluene was shipped however upon opening the package, I discovered x3 - 4L metal cans of toluene.  The maximum quantity which can be shipped under packing instruction 353 is 5L.  She would have had to use packing instruction 364 which then makes the shipping of this quantity of product ( 12L) a violation on a aircraft with passengers.   If she had broken up the shipment into 3 individual shipments, it would have bee allowed because each container would have been under the 5L limit for shipment using packing instruction 353.  Furthermore, there was no adherence to packing instruction 5.0.2.12 which states Inner packagings which are liable to break or puncture easily... must be secured secured to the outer packaging with suitable cushioning material.  Any leakage of contents must not substantially impair the protective properties of the cushioning material or of the outer packaging \r\nWhich means, the bubble wrap was not sufficient cushioning for the quantity and weight of the containers.  If one of the thin walled steel containers were punctured, there was no absorbant material such as vermiculite to absorb the spillage.

As the originator noted had there been a confirmed regulatory violation it is possible that it could result in a monetary penalty being levied to NCA.  Under certain circumstances propping doors open is not entirely an unacceptable practice provided the door is being monitored.  It appears that perhaps the door was left unattended but it is not confirmed and as a result the circumstances are not confirmed to be a breach of regulations.  A security reminder SOM (attached) was issued to all staff as a reminder of the closed/locked door requirements in YYC and YEG facilities.

This type of FDR can be used on a AC or DC electrical system, but the 1900D in our serial number ranges are built to operate DC only.  Upon repair/testing it was discovered that there is no converter installed in the CVR (which would make the unit equivelent to a PN 93-A100-80 which requires AC power to run). At some point in the aircraft history, this machine had been modified to AC power only to the FDR.  During import no record was found, and the corredt part number was installed, so we had nothing to alert us to the not-Canadian-approved modification being installed.

Rich Milton and I had several flight legs over the span of Sunday and Monday. All flight legs were planned to be taking off and landing during official aviation day. Sundays flight were preformed as per normal. On Monday, our last leg of the day would take us from KSFO to CYYC. Our planned departure time was between 5pm to 5:30pm local time. Rich and I discussed two times about my night currency being expired, and whether or not we would be landing in CYYC before official night. Each time we spoke of it, we came to the conclusion that we would be landing in Calgary during daylight hours. It was going to be a flight just under 2 hours airtime. I never remembered to think of it again. \r\nOur passengers showed up to the FBO Signature with many bottles of wine valued over $10,000. Rich called Canpass and was on hold with them for a lengthy time, while the passengers and wine were loaded onto the plane. Rich got off the phone, needing more info from the passengers, and came onto the plane to ask the passengers the required information. He then had to call Canpass back and was on hold again for a lengthy time period. Each time he was on the phone, the lengthy time period was due to holding on the phone waiting for a representative to answer the call. The Canpass agent was not satisfied with the new information, and told Rich to get more info. He then had to call Canpass a third time, after getting additional info from the passengers.\r\nWhen Rich eventually got off the phone with Canpass satisfied, it was 6:30pm local time.

The squib was due for replacement on September 14th, 2013.  on September 12th 2013 the RH #1 fire bottle squib was replaced, the work was released and paperwork sent to QA in YYC.  The work package then went to YXJ for tech records processing and the card was closed.  When the aircraft returned to base on September 17th, planning was looking at the duelist and discovered that the wrong SN squib had been replaced.

When I posted the card for the extinguisher cartridge replacement I did not record the SN of the squib that was needed to be changed on  the WinAir card only the position, I only transcribed the CAMP item as it shows in the title.  I also did not print the CAMP card out and attach it to the WinAir card like I normally do (I forgot) that would have had the correct SN to be changed on it.\r\n\r\nWhen the engineer was replacing the RH #1 fire bottle squib, they did not question if they had the correct squib as there are 2 in stalled on each of 2 bottles (4 total).\r\n\r\nWhen the ACA engineer was making the maintenance release they did not question if the correct squib SN had been changed.\r\n\r\nWhen YYC QA audited the card they did not question if the correct squib had been replaced.\r\n\r\nWhen tech records processed the NCA work card they did not confirm if the correct squib was \r\nreplaced(there was no WinAir confirmation as the information is not tracked in WinAir).\r\n\r\nThere is no clear process for who should be making the CAMP entries.

We did a quick turn in CRL4 returning to CYEG. At some point between start-up in CRL4 and making initial radio contact with ATC airborne, I received a voice mail from Centre requesting an arrival report. I didn't hear the voice mail until back in CYEG and at that point we had already been in radio contact with ATC on the outbound leg so no further phone calls were made.\r\n\r\nWe were airborne and in contact with ATC before our 60 minute window to file an arrival expired, so no CARs violation occurred. The phone call from Centre was a courtesy call before actual lost comm procedures were initiated and indicated that they expected they would be in radio contact before the 60 minutes expired.\r\n\r\nI genuinely forgot to call though, so it is only by the timing of the legs that no violation occurred.",My normal routine is to immediately call OCC upon arrival and then Centre.

2063,13-09-17 7:30,DHC-8,Operations procedures,,Proactive Safety Observation,During flight - 25000 ft,Low Risk,"During medical emergency, FA and ABP administered oxygen.  FA realized that they may make quite a quick decent and landing due to emergency, and that cabin was VERY unsecure. Large plastic meal boxes were just distributed and all table trays were down. There were 36 pax on board the 37 pax aircraft. FA directed an ABP to collect all garbage while she tended to sick pax.  ABP did so and had trouble getting through the aisles with such a large amount of garbage, and such a full aircraft.  ABP then assisted the FA to get the over sized amount of garbage into the lavatory so that aircraft was secure when landing.\r\n\r\n37 MEALS SHOULD NOT BE SERVED ON A DH100 AIRCRAFT!  \r\nNot only does it cause a danger prior to serving the meals, as there is not enough room in the front closet for all the meals,coolers, extra vitamin waters etc etc. so meals and coolers with hot portions are having to be kept in overhead bins, which now means more baggage at people's feet which is a danger in itself.\r\n\r\nThe closet and overhead bins are not cool!  We are serving eggs and yogurt out of a warm closet.  We are going to end up with a plane load of pax with food poisoning one day!  The cargo area of a 300 aircraft is cool....just like a fridge!  This seems the logical place to store perishable foods!\r\n\r\nOn a normal full DH100 flight with meals, the garbage bag usually has to sit in front of the jump seat prior to landing so that pax may access the lavatory.  Yes....it is sitting RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR MAIN EMERGENCY EXIT!!!\r\n\r\nDuring a medical emergency as we experienced yesterday, having to deal with a large bag of garbage in the aisle, and having to store it, really was time consuming and in my opinion dangerous!  On a DH300, the ABP could have walked to back collecting garbage, and threw bag in cargo door.  Again...our flight was completely full, and for us to access cargo door, would have meant unsecuring and moving more pax around on  an already crowded aircraft during an emergency.","Companies trying to save money by overloading the cheaper, smaller aircraft.","James Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Sept 18 2013 13:05.

This request was relayed by the radio room to Corey Handbury, who at the time was loading bags into NCB1111 ran over to the passengers to stop them from walking behind the aircraft and held them until the running aircraft had taxied off the ramp.Once it was safe to do so I escorted the three passengers over to the NCB1121 and Corey returned to loading bags.","Manifests seemed to be incorrect, (I was not doing check in and am not sure if this is actually true).\r\npassengers able to leave the terminal with the wrong boarding passes.\r\nPassengers told to leave an aircraft to head back to the terminal unescorted with running aircraft on ramp.","September 19 2013 3;12 pm yxj\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nChanged to occurrence \r\nNo maintenance action requiredâ™¦\r\nHandling risk MED>3-3,  unescorted passengers ?\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Sept 19 2013 handling risk med. 3-2.

Currently planning to have to audio system in DFT modified to remove the ISO comm box and install more reliable audio control system; similar system to what recently installed in DFN.  Plan to be completed by summer 2014.  The replacement of the audio control system in this aircraft is not all to do with this SMS report but mostly because of high rate of failure with that system, and also to this aircraft.  \r\nRecommend the secondary proactive safety register be set to maintenance general.  the risk rating be set to low, and this report be closed.    \r\n\r\nAndrew Matson - SMS - April 17, 2014  0945L\r\nBased on investigator's notes, and in discussion with QA Maintenance, unable to verify procedural failure.

Waypoints coming back from CYVR such as ADSIX and KESTA (part of preferred routes) are not in RP.  These waypoints have been around for at least 2 months now but are not in the RP database.  We had to manually write in the routing for ATC for our flight plan.\r\n\r\nThis creates a hazard of not having proper flight planning for fuel burns, and possible confusion in routing.

During regular daily line flying, please verify that the peers you are flying with are aware of and can demonstrate the use of this procedure in the various GPS units you are flying with.  Please communicate the importance of using all available tools for situational awareness (i.e. shake what your momma gave you).  We have had two such instances of aircraft lined up off centerline in sky clear visual conditions, one terminating in a go-around issued by tower and another ending in a landing on a road beside an airport.\r\n\r\nWe need to put focus on strengthening our culture to ALWAYS tune any available nav-aids (i.e. ILS, LOC - also indicated in our SOPs) or create the pseudo-centerline EVEN when operating in VFR conditions.  There are many detailed accident or incident reports of airline aircraft lining up on the wrong runway for landing/departure or landing at the wrong airport. In all cases it was unintentional and avoidable.  So prolific an issue the industry developed RAAS (Runway Awareness and Advisory System) to combat this problem.  Unfortunately we do not all have the advantage of this equipment, but that does not mean we do not have the tools or guidance at our disposal to mitigate our risk.\r\n\r\nWe will incorporate this procedure into future LOFT scenarios in the coming spring\r\n\r\nJan 14 2014-1;08 pm yxj\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\n have reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found;\r\na.

2106,13-10-08 7:30,B 1900D,Airspace/Clearance Deviation,,Occurrence,On Departure out of CYEG,Medium Risk,"As the Captain, Steve Judge was PF on the first leg of the day, and our flight was restricted to 7000 as per the Edmonton 3 Departure instructions, and we were on vectors for traffic from Edmonton Depature Control.  During the climb out in C-FNCL, which is non-autopilot equipped, we were given a series of vectors towards the on-course.  The First Officer, Mark Friesen, made the 6000 for 7000 call , to which I responded 6000 for 7000 as per SOPs.  Approaching the 7000 foot level-off altitude, Departure Control called and gave a further vector, to which the PM responded and I confirmed.  As PF, I selected the new heading on the heading bug, and began a turn to the required heading.  As I recall, the 100 to go call was missed due to the timing of the call from, and response to, Departure.  I was hand-flying, following the command bars to the new turn heading, and was momentarily distracted from the level-off task, which the PM noticed and verbalized as we passed through 7000 feet.  I immediately realised my error, and began to level the aircraft and return to the req'd 7000 foot restriction, but we were at approximately 7300 feet before the aircraft climb was arrested and we actually began to descend.  Since I had passengers aboard, I elected not to aggressively push the nose foward to regain the altitude, but instead made the transition gradual, with passenger comfort in mind.  Departure called during this transition to confim that we were indeed planning on leveling at 7000 feet, and we confrimed that this was the case and that the level off was in progress.  The remainder of the flight continued without incident.  ",Distraction of the PF during a critical phase of flight due to a call from Departure control for a heading change caused a momentary loss of situational awareness due to fixation on one phase of the flight to the detriment of another.  ,"Richelle Singer-SMS-October 16, 2013-1200L\r\nPer email on October 16, 2013 from Mark Friesen report submitted.\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Oct 16 2013 13:03 handling risk med 2-5.

I hit the top cowl numerous times to create a vibration and observed the latch rotating away from placard markings.  Upon other re-latch attempt, I was able to observe that the latch was not quite fastening over hooking bracket and over centering mechanism would not allow proper operation.  The latch would then fall back in the unlatch position.  Top cowl was then removed and latch inspected.  After cleaning latch, it was observed that the mechanism exhibits stiffness.  Upon further inspection and evalution, we proceeded to attempt to re-fasten latch.  Norman Wong was successful at re-fastening latch in question.

The crew had noticed that the airplane was feeling sluggish, with airframe yaw and buffet, but could not place the cause. Upon noticing that the 3 green lights were still illuminated, both pilots checked the airspeed. It was below 180 knots, so they elected to recycle  the gear. Nothing changed - the handle moved, but there was no pump noise or gear movement, and the in-transit lights did not illuminate either. They selected the gear handle down, and left it down for the remainder of the flight. They snagged the gear on landing.\r\n\r\nThe gear in transit lights were tested in the morning as part of the flight compartment checks, and checked normally.\r\n\r\nThis is a human error, of the type Action Error - Lapse: These â€˜skill-basedâ€™ errors occur if attention is diverted, even momentarily.  Resulting action is not intended; Short-term memory lapse; omit to perform a required action. The crew member saw what he expected to see: red lights in the handle were out.

2146,13-11-06 19:30,None,Facilities,Third Party Actions ,Occurrence,Travelodge YYC,Low Risk,"During our stay at the travelodge in YYC, Nathon and I both noticed that both the elevators were shaking and making loud noises. We remarked to each other they did not feel safe. Neither elevator displayed a certificate to indicate it had been inspected, what the max load was, how many people it could safely hold, etc. While we were talking about our concerns in the lobby, another guest overheard us and informed us he got stuck in one of the elevators a few minutes beforehand. Shortly after we spoke to him another guest came out of the stairwell to inform the hotel that he had just been freed from the same elevator, as it had become stuck again (same one as the previous guest, about 20 min after him, maintainance had to return to free him too). \r\n\r\nCariboo obviously has no control over this, other than to use other hotels.\r\n","The elevator became stuck. \r\n\r\nThis safety concern was highlighted by the overall poor treatment of us and other guests and substandard facilities at the hotel.\r\n\r\nNathon and I had a very unpleasant stay there. Both rooms were very cold from leaking air conditioners, my room was missing a window pane which also caused a large draft (my room was 13 deg C with a noticeable breeze when I got in).  The rooms were dirty (food on furniture, mold in bathrooms). We were treated rudely both on check-in and check-out, and we were denied rooms until we provided a personal credit card, despite the NCA credit card being on file. I asked to speak to a manager at check-out but was informed there wasn`t one on duty, despite a sign on the desk stating the name of the manager on duty. It took us fifteen minutes to check-out because there was a line of 3 people in front of us, all of whom had complaints, and all were treated as rudely as we were. The names of the employee we dealt with were Bob (check-in) and Rel (check-out).\r\n\r\nAll of that to say, the general attitude at the hotel did not seem to be one of concern for the guests well-being or needs. \r\n\r\n","November 7 2013 4;10 PM YYC\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nHandling risk low\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Nov 8 2013 10:30 - handling 1-4 low assigned to manager secondary manager assigned.\r\n\r\nGordon Bowers, Manager, Operations Control Centre\r\nThe travel Lodge has been removed from the OCC hotel call list effective immediately. \r\nA memo has been issued to all OCC staff not to use this hotel. 08/11/2013  \r\n\r\nNovember 19 2013\r\nDeborah Kominko Assistant Chief Pilot 703/704\r\nSpoke with crew.

Due to the fact the APU was unserviceable, we would not have electrical power available for cabin lighting when disembarking the passengers at night. I contacted YYC ops to arrange an AC power cart to ensure power was available to the aircraft for disembarking the passengers. NCA does not have a mobile AC power cart so the ground handling staff would have to use the cart from Canadian North and as it turned out, Canadian Norths cart was unserviceable........ Hence, no power was available.......In order to deplane the passengers safely on the dark ramp, the number 4 engine had to be left running to ensure electrical power was available for cabin lighting. Ground staff and flight attendants were briefed about the procedure to deplane the passengers and many escorts were available to assist. The passengers were deplaned with the #4 engine running and the aircraft was shut down about 3 minutes later.","Causes:\r\n1) APU became unserviceable.\r\n2) NCA does not have a functioning AC power cart even though there has been a need for one since the 146 became active in the fleet.\r\n3) There was no other AC power cart available to the ramp staff.\r\n\r\nI think this is a great example of a company system failure;\r\nPoint number two is what bothers me the most - An AC power cart has been needed for two years, yet I have been told by several people in management positions that a reliable cart has never been purchased due to high costs.\r\nThis issue has been known about for a long time and nothing has been done to rectify it.

Of course, the E-light switch was in the ARMED position and as power was lost they came on. \r\n\r\nI had to re-light the APU, bring the gen on-line, and then select the E-lights to OFF in order to latch them OFF.

None of the snags involved avionics, yaw damp or spoilers so they didnt' need to be left on. \r\n\r\nI should have down a more comprehensive pre-shut down check myself and would have caught the E-lights in the ARMED position. As it was I needed to put an additional cycle on the APU to shut down the E-lights.

2166,13-11-15 12:00,None,Miscellaneous,,Occurrence,YYC Beverage cooler storage area,Low Risk,"Attached to this report are five (5) pictures that I've taken in the last little while showing mold and/or general grime in some of the beverage coolers that we use board our aircraft.  My observation for some time has been that the practice of not doing a basic towel-dry of the coolers after they are emptied at the end of a flight trip, and then storing the coolers with the lids closed, is causing this mold and grime to develop.  This is especially the case when a cooler sits for several days before being used again.\r\n\r\nOn quite a number of occasions, I have had to clean out a cooler before use in order to remove this mold and grime.  Unfortunately, there were no cleaning supplies readily available to properly sanitize said containers, and the cleaning with water and paper towel just removed the visible surface mold and/or grime.\r\n\r\nThe concern here is that we are not providing a relatively cleaning (or sanitary) container for the beverages that our passengers consume.  I feel that it could be just a matter of time before one of our passengers notices this, and takes a picture or otherwise forwards a complaint to NCA about the appearance of our containers.  (Note that sometimes coffee stains are also visible, apparently left uncleaned following use, on the outside of the lid of these containers.)\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is that the company consider communicating to flight crews and flight attendants that a basic cleaning and towel-dry is required after each us, and, further, that the coolers be stored with the lids OPEN to allow air to circulate and completely dry out the containers while they are not in use.  This could mean that a larger storage space might need to be arranged for the coolers.\r\n\r\nA further recommendation would be to have someone responsible for periodically cleaning/sanitizing all of the coolers.\r\n\r\nA few notes regarding this report:\r\n\r\n#1) The date and time (shown above) are arbitrary - the observations of the above conditions have been observed fairly regularly for several months.\r\n\r\n#2) For the 'Equipment' section above, 'None' was selected as nothing listed seemed to be applicable.\r\n\r\n#3) For the 'Category' section below, 'Miscellaneous' was selected as I did not see anything related to health and/or sanitation, or equipment used for customer service.

Aircraft was released and after first flight the gauge was showing 21psi which is out of the green arc, basically the gauge was pegged. Thereâ€™s a pressure relief that opens 3psi above the regulated pressure so the max should have only been 22psi. Pilot smartly did not use the boots and when it returned we replaced the regulator. So it appears to have been a component failure, the regulator failed causing too much pressure to the old boots which failed, the crack appears to have started at the patch on each side which would be a weak point. \r\nRecommended for closure based on standard risk assessment for component failure.\r\n\r\nAndree Ziswiler - SMS- Dec 13, 2013 1640 MST\r\nThe Report was Closed by the SMS Committee on Dec 12, 2013 pending the addition of the Company Financial Loss\r\n\r\nAndree Ziswiler - SMS - Dec 24, 2013 0950 MST\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Dec 5 2013 reviewed\r\n\r\nJan 10 2014-2;56 pm yxj\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\n have reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found;\r\na.

Daniel brought it to my attention, so we  proceeded to take a closer look. From a ladder, I could see that there were several inches of snow piled deeper in the cowling. With that, we decided that it would take a bit more than using a broom, and suggested that we get it pulled into a hanger. Ramp management then informed us that that plane had already been indoors for several hours that morning. So we informed dispatch that it was probably a no go with either of the D-100s, as they were both outdoors over the weekend.

SMS 2172, we received a picture depicting where the aircraft were, there was a marshaller standing in front of the incoming KA200 which put him or her between the moving passengers and the running aircraft. With regards to SMS 2226, we reviewed video from the camera; the aircraft are on opposite ends of the ramp and pose no safety hazard. With both of these reports, the submitter seems concerned with having any passengers on the ramp while ANY aircraft are running, while this is a good practice, it is not always practical, we are at an airport, next to a busy taxi-lane, and across from a busy EFC ramp, thereâ€™s ALWAYS going to be noise. We can not mitigate the hazard of â€˜noiseâ€™ at an airport. Every situation is going to be slightly different but as long as the passengers are in no danger of being struck by moving aircraft or propellers, we should not delay their movement because of noise. In submitting these reports the submitter brought up the possibility for a Safety hazard, sheâ€™s noting that she was not informed and therefore could not make a decision to protect the passengers from what she perceived as a safety hazard. Ultimately the passenger movement is up to the person escorting the passengers as they are not to be let out to wander the ramp by themselves, the FA on larger aircraft and one of the pilots on the smaller aircraft are responsible to escort the passengers. To improve communication another handheld radio was purchased and positioned at the check-in desk at the far west side of the facility so if there was a need to communicate with Ramp staff, they can now do so. The CSAs have all been informed of the new radio and if there are any questions at all, they can now call the ramp and ask. The FA or the pilots should be making the call as to whether theyâ€™re ready to take the passengers to their aircraft, if thereâ€™s a question about aircraft movement, now they can confer with the CSA and call ramp on the radio.

Individual driving the tug was the supervisor and took the conditions of the ramp into consideration before moving aircraft and unfortunately the ramp proved to be slippery. The investigation reflects the cause as a human error and an unintentional deviation from standard procedures. The individual was given all appropriate training and procedures, but made a poor judgement call on the conditions of the day. The tug in question has caused problems in the past and presents a safety hazard during winter operations due to being only two wheel drive, the front brakes always stop first (this works well in the summer but in the winter causes sliding). The fact the front brakes stopped first would be considered the part of the cause of the tug sliding but the fact the submitter chose to use the tug in the first place is considered the root cause. We only use this tug when needed and never in icy conditions. Currently it is removed from service due to a broken emergency brake, poor starting and general need of TLC. Iâ€™ve opened another SMS report to track the safety issue of the tug during winter operations.

There were many factors this particular evening that lead to the missed communication, mostly the fact the crew had become complacent because the Flair aircraft usually parks in the rear and they seem to be more on the ball and donâ€™t wait for us to tell them the forward aircraft is about to start, they close the door before the crew has to communicate and so the point of communicating was lost. After the red beacon goes on indicating the forward aircraft is about to start, there is lots of smoke and noise before they receive any blast, so anyone sitting in the cockpit of the rear aircraft should conceivably have time to react if they see the signs. The captain of the Canadian North aircraft was upset that we didnâ€™t let him know and so the submitter entered the report to track the occurrence in case a report was submitted in Canadian Northâ€™s SMS; at this point there has been no contact from Canadian North. This report brings up the aircraft that EFC had parked an aircraft on the lead-in line, we had parked our Dash 8-300 on EFCâ€™s ramp due to space requirements of two Boeings on our ramp, we left room for the 737 to follow the lead-in line, EFC pulled out a Citation from Hangar 2 and parked it on the lead-in line side of the Dash even though there was lots of room on the hangar side, then the fuel truck pulled up and further blocked the lead-in line. Karl went to ask them to move it but the 737 was taxiing in at this point and he assessed the room requirements and made it work although the 737 ended up in a sharper angle than usual leaving the door more in front of the jet blast. Submitter was reminded he has the authority to stop an incoming aircraft until other aircraft or vehicles are out of the way and crew was reminded about communicating when aircraft are about to start.

Crew requested direct the Inital Approach Waypoint of SELEL and was cleared as requested and to descend to 4000 feet ASL.  Shortly before transitioning to the IAWP, the crew was cleared first to the IF, and then the FAWP due to conflicting traffic out of another oilsands airport.  The crew was also managing 3 radio freq's at the time, with Oilsands Traffic and Albian Unicom in addition to Edmonton Centre.  After crossing SELEL, the crew began a descent to 3700 (the cold-wx corrected transition altitude), but the approach clearance had not yet been received.  ATC called to confirm the altitude, and the crew corrected to 4000, and held this altitude until approximately 1 mile from the FAWP.  The rest of the approach proceeded without incident.  ","High radio workload and a non-standard clearance (first to LENAV via SELEL, then to NUDOK via LENAV) contributed. The crew mistakenly descended on the approach without the necessary clearance.

Although the flight crew was cleared to the next waypoint, they had not been cleared to descend, as depicted on the approach plate, as they had not been cleared for the approach.\r\n\r\nA factor in this incident is the very busy airspace, and the need to monitor several radio frequencies at once.\r\n\r\nIn review, the impact to safety management and the likelihood of reoccurrence is determined to be low.

I asked Farouk and Ryan about it as I could not find the other 1089 and Farouk told me that Karie Karpowich had filed as 1089 on AQN YEG-YYC. The flight follower was showing Karie as Flt 2023. Farouk said he was aware of this, the reason being that Karie was previously planned to position AQN YEG-YYC as 1089 but she ended up doing a Statoil rescue YEG-YYC due to another mechanical Dash in YEG. Farouk left the Statoil flight number in the flight follower as she was now doing a Statoil trip and wanted it shown as a Statoil flight number, and Karie kept her positioning flight number in order to keep her Flow time to YYC. I then asked what flight number Alan should use as he could not take off as 1089 and Ryan told me to use 1082. Later on in the night we heard Alan talking to another aircraft on the radio asking if they were also filed as 1082.

Email sent to manager to request risk rating change to low based on initial investigation notes.\r\n\r\nKen Pratt January 2, 2014- SMS 2172, 2226 are essentially the same and so we are investigating them together. SMS 2172, we received a picture depicting where the aircraft were, there was a marshaller standing in front of the incoming KA200 which put him or her between the moving passengers and the running aircraft. With regards to SMS 2226, we reviewed video from the camera; the aircraft are on opposite ends of the ramp and pose no safety hazard. With both of these reports, the submitter seems concerned with having any passengers on the ramp while ANY aircraft are running, while this is a good practice, it is not always practical, we are at an airport, next to a busy taxi-lane, and across from a busy EFC ramp, thereâ€™s ALWAYS going to be noise. We can not mitigate the hazard of â€˜noiseâ€™ at an airport. Every situation is going to be slightly different but as long as the passengers are in no danger of being struck by moving aircraft or propellers, we should not delay their movement because of noise. In submitting these reports the submitter brought up the possibility for a Safety hazard, sheâ€™s noting that she was not informed and therefore could not make a decision to protect the passengers from what she perceived as a safety hazard. Ultimately the passenger movement is up to the person escorting the passengers as they are not to be let out to wander the ramp by themselves, the FA on larger aircraft and one of the pilots on the smaller aircraft are responsible to escort the passengers. To improve communication another handheld radio was purchased and positioned at the check-in desk at the far west side of the facility so if there was a need to communicate with Ramp staff, they can now do so. The CSAâ€™s have all been informed of the new radio and if there are any questions at all, they can now call the ramp and ask. The FA or the pilots should be making the call as to whether theyâ€™re ready to take the passengers to their aircraft, if thereâ€™s a question about aircraft movement, now they can confer with the CSA and call ramp on the radio.

Aircraft was left outside over night and had over 6 inches of snow on it.  No plugs, ties, or pitot static covers were installed on the aircraft.  Aircraft was initially parked in front of hanger 5 and then moved to the far west end in front of hanger 2.  The APU is MEL'd inop and initially were told to battery start on departure.  We requested to be moved or find a ground power since we had no APU and we require power on for 15 mins for emergency lighting strips.  Ground crews managed to get a ground power from Regional 1.  ",We have a lack of sufficient ramp space and ground power units for our operation.  Also better planning and prioritizing of flights based on departure times should be considered.  Our aircraft was moved from the front of hanger 5 so the Challenger could be placed there.  Our passengers had to walk a considerable distance to board across very slippery ramp conditions.  As we were planned to department 30 mins prior to the Challenger our aircraft should have had priority.  There was also a B1900 parked in front of hanger 6.  Neither the 1900 or PDR required ground power to start.  \r\n\r\nParking the aircraft so far away and boarding a large number of pax is a safety concern.  Especially with the ramp conditions and the number of aircraft on the ramp.  Leaving aircraft outside like this is also unacceptable.  There were not a large number of departures this morning and because of the snow cover we took significant delays which could have been avoided.\r\n,"James Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Dec 16 2013 12:45 handling risk med 2-4.

This report is being submitted to track the safety issue and document the repair or replacement of the tug.,"The medium size Sicard Tug has caused many close calls due to several factors;\r\n\r\n1) It has really good front brakes and not powerful enough rear brakes\r\n2) It has large rear tires and is geared really low giving the back wheels lots of drive (torque)\r\n3) It has a homebuilt parking brake that needs improvement\r\n4) In the cold it idles high due to being an old carbureted model\r\n5) It is lighter on the front wheels and has lots of traction on rear tires.\r\n\r\nAll these factors lead to sliding when the brakes are applied, the front brakes lock up and the back tires drive or push the tug making it slide worse.\r\nCurrently the Tug is parked and out of service due to broken parking brake, poor starting leaving us with one small baggage tug and our enormous tug that nobody wants to drive due to being slow and more difficult than other tugs.

After correcting the brake line plumbing and bleeding the brakes, the tug seemed much better; the step-down regulator was not needed. After some more testing we determined the LH back drum was not fully engaging, we removed the wheels and adjusted the off-center cams to make the brake shoes grab sooner. The brakes are now acceptable for continued use. We overhauled the carburetor, adjusted the throttle linkage to make the power come on smoother and it now starts and runs much better. We also fixed the parking brake by reinforcing a transition point for the actuating cable, and fixing the parking brake back-plate, it now works very well. Tug is back in service.

2250,13-12-22 9:30,Ground Support Equipment,Ground Servicing,,Occurrence,CYMM EFC Ramp,Low Risk,"EFC ramp attendants connected ground power to the aircraft after the crew parked on the ramp. Marcos selected external power on the DC control panel, and power was not available from the GPU. The flight crew signaled the ramp attendants to check the GPU.  External power was then selected, and available.  The flight crew signaled thumbs up to the ramp attendants to indicate that the ground power was working.  Approximately two minutes later, the ramp attendant disconnected the GPU and towed it away without being instructed to do so by the flight crew.  After the flight crew recognized that the GPU had been disconnected, we turned off the external power switch and the battery master.  After the GPU was returned to the airplane and connected, the flight crew informed the ramp shift manager of the situation.  ","I think that the main cause of what happened was the fact that there is only one GPU available at EFC in Fort McMurray.  There was another Dash 8 without an APU parked next to us who was also in need of a GPU in order to start engines and depart.  The temperature was -38 degrees, so battery starts were undesirable.  At some point there must have been some confusion as to who needed the GPU the most.  The ramp attendants were busy relocating the GPU, and did not seek permission to disconnect it first.

2251,13-12-23 14:00,CL601,Landing Gear (system or operation),Operations procedures,Occurrence,CYQM,High Risk,"On departure from CYQM to CYYC , a gear retraction was completed  with only the 2 main gear successfully completing the retraction cycle. The nose gear remained down with a green safe indication and the nose door closed. We attempted a gear cycle to attempt to rectify the problem ( at this time there were no other indications contrary to a safe attempt at cycling the gear, ie a WOW input/output indication. The second attempt at retraction resulted in the same indication. At this point we had no other choice but to extend the gear down and return for a landing, shortly after this the annunciator for a WOW input failure illuminated. We instructed Moncton center of the situation and requested vectors to return but to give us some extra time to complete the required Abnormal QRH actions for the WOW input failure. In Addition we had to dump the tail tank of fuel and inform Leah that we were retruning for a landing, once these actions were completed we requested and were accomodated for a return approach onto runway 29 in Moncton. The ATC controller had asked if we required any assisstance or if we were requesting emergency services to which we replied that this was unnecessary, however he arranged for these services of his own accord for our arrival. After a successful approach and landing we taxied to the ramp and inspected the landing gear for any possible abnormalities that we could perhaps attribute to the WOW issue. After an inspection we made an uneducated guess that perhaps the prox sensors, which were covered in a substantial amount of ice, may have resulted in the illumination of the WOW input annunciator and prevented the gear from properly retracting. At this point we made the decision to get accomodations and stay the night in Moncton due to duty day limitations.\r\n It should also be noted that the next day, after heating and completly drying the landing gear of all ice debris ,a second attempt was made to depart Moncton with even less success, all 3 gear remained down with the gear lever lock remaining in place. We completed the QRH and returned again. At this point it was evident that the issue would require maintenance action from qualified personnel. In discussion with company management from both the Flight Ops and Maintenance depts , the decision was consenually made to depart Moncton with gear down , and return to Calgary. We successfully arrived back in Calgary late sunday night, with the defect being recorded into the aircraft journey log book.","Unknown, however possibly a WOW system logic problem.","James Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Dec 24 2013 handling risk low 2-2 assigned to manager.

Shortly thereafter I received a call from Brian Dixon as I had a conversation with Shayla (supervisor in YMM) earlier in the morning to review the passenger lists via IBS and confirm that the counts/passengers were correct for the departures out of YMM for December 20th. In discussions with Shayla she will be diligently working through the information captured in IBS and cross reference with the information that she has on hand. \r\n\r\n- On December 21st post arrival of Flight 9140 into YQM, I was advised that there were 4 passengers who were destined to YHM, no reservations were created in the system for these passengers thus in turn we had no record of these passengers being boarded out of YMM. Reservations were created shortly thereafter as these passengers were created from YMM-YQY and then YQY to YXU.\r\n\r\n- I received another email from Shayla in YMM to review the counts that I had for Flight 9136 (BAe146) out of YMM as it was reflected in IBS that there were 79 passengers boarded on this flight, however it was confirmed with Tyson Cann that there was no empty seats out of YMM (1 seat occupied by Tyson and the other by Theo - company personnel) which would bring the total to 82 passengers as opposed to the 79 listed in IBS. \r\n\r\n\r\n",#NAME?,"James Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Dec 24 2013 11:35 - initial handling risk med 3-3 loss of control of passenger manifests.

2260,13-12-27 13:30,BE 200,Weather,Landing Gear (system or operation),Occurrence,CYYE ,Medium Risk,"On landing in Fort Nelson we had frozen brakes on all 4 main wheels.  On departure we were dealing with moderate drifting snow and drifts between 2 to 5 inches deep during the taxi. On take-off just prior to rotation we hit 4 to 5 snow drifts that were 3 to 4 inches deep. I only used the brakes 2 times.  The first was coming to a stop after repositioning away from the hanger.  And the 2nd was to help with the turn around on the button of 02 for take-off.\r\n\r\nPrior to touch down in Fort Nelson I was expecting frozen brakes and touched down a little harder than normal to insure that the brakes would break free on touch down.  As I touched down I was using a lot of rudder control to keep the aircraft going straight as each brake broke free.  I brought the aircraft to a complete stop on the runway due to the aircraft continuing to veer to the left like the on of the main wheels was still frozen.  I notified YYE radio that we would have to hold on the runway prior to moving to inspect for damage prior to moving.  I feathered the props and had the Cody inspect for a flat tire as I briefed the passengers.  We did not have a flat tire and I was able to taxi off the runway and to Bailey's hanger with no issues.  On the taxi back the airplane did require more left rudder control than usual to taxi, to me this felt like one of the brakes was still freezing and releasing.\r\n\r\nWe briefed the passengers prior to them leaving and then I inspected each wheel to see if any cord was showing on the 4 scrubbed spots on the tires.  I contacted the chief pilot on call to notify him with what had happened and for direction so that I could try and get the incident dealt with quickly and efficiently.  After talking with the Trevor Dallman the chief pilot on call I contacted maintenance in CYXJ and sent them pictures of each scrub spot on the tires.  Maintenance confirmed that the tires were still airworthy.   We then notified operations that we were able to do the next leg of our trip and not take a delay.\r\n\r\nWhen passengers arrived we boarded for departure 1 hr early.  As we were taxiing for departure Cody was having to use full left rudder and differential braking and power to keep the aircraft straight.  We made the immediate decision that there was a major issue with the nose gear.  Cody carefully and smoothly parked the aircraft back in front of the Bailey hanger as I briefed the passengers and notified Fort Nelson radio that we were no longer taxiing for departure and asked him to delay our departure time by 1 hr.  We parked the aircraft with no issues and Cody took the passengers while I called operations and Nathaniel.  Nathaniel had me check the nose gear steering control arm and I found the control arm had separated at the spring and missing a clip.  I snagged the airplane and notified operations that we could not fly the airplane till the airplane was fixed. \r\n\r\nWhen Nathaniel and the rescue airplane got to Fort St. John we were down to 1 hr left in our duty day.  I consulted Cody to see if he comfortable in extending our duty day due to this unforeseen maintenance delay.  We both agreed that we were fit to fly and comfortable to extend our day due to the unforeseen maintenance delay.  I then confirmed with Deborah Kominko that we were applying the extension to maximum flight duty due to unforeseeable operational circumstances properly.\r\n\r\nAfter Nathaniel Dirks fixed the airplane we flew back to Fort St. John.\r\n",Snow Drifts in Fort St. John and Frozen Brakes,"Dec. 30 2013-9;06 am yxj\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nThe crew entered the defect as required\r\nMaintenance flew to fort nelson and rectified the defect TC 132249-280 and released the work.\r\nHandling risk Med-3-3 due to damage to NLG steering link tube.\r\nNo further maintenance action required.\r\n\r\nDec 30 2013\r\nDeborah Kominko Assistant Chief Pilot 703/704\r\nSpoke with flight crew in YYE (I was part of the rescue flight).

At time of meeting, no incursions since added Red Boxes to taxiways, up to 1 week prior to meeting. Was 1 incursion day before meeting.\r\n3. Difference between ICAO definition and NavCanada definition of runway incursion causes differences in numbers.\r\n4. Lit stop bars are only used under LVOP/RVOP. \r\n5. Potential risk has been identified with runway/runway intersections ie. 29 as taxiway and 35 as runway. There are no Red Boxes on 29. \r\n6. In RVR 600, need inset lighting to taxi. Can ask for follow-me truck to get to runway. This occurs (RVR 600) about 40 hours per year. \r\n\r\nNext meeting will be in March/April 2015.\r\n\r\nNov 5 2014\r\nLanny Benoit DFO\r\n2 additional SMS reports, 2750 and 2766 were related to taxiway deviations. Both occurred at the Y intersection on RWY 26. Both relate to ATC clearances onto C, but the flight crew turned onto Y. As per Flight Ops QA:\r\n\r\nThere was no runway incursion, no hard number limit exceedance. The events were self-reported and there has been no indication of an operational impact.\r\n\r\nPer discussion with VP ops, these are similar occurrences, but do not constitute a trend at the same intersection. Investigator Classroom Training in NCA SMS identifies a trend as, Recurring theme in reported events, event outcomes, contributing factors, root causes of conditions. Based on review, the previous incursion happened in 2011, and there was no identifiable trend of taxi deviations at this intersection. 2 in 1 week does not at this point constitute a trend. Does not need to be reported to Transport Canada.\r\n\r\nHowever, to ensure continued flight crew diligence, SMS Safety Bulletin re Hot Spot at this location will be re-issued. See attached. SMS will re-issue this Safety Bulletin.\r\n\r\nPrior to these 2 reports, there had been no taxiway or runway deviations reported to NCA since April 2014. Based on this, the re-issuing of the Safety Bulletin and the actions taken by the YYC Airport Authority to improve signage and markings, it is recommended that this Proactive Safety Observation be closed.  \r\n\r\nRFC.\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk Nov 5 2014-Q/A Mgr Flt Ops; I have reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found; a.

Recognizing that the form had not been submitted to TC, after reviewing the Flight Permit form, I realized that it was not correctly executed as the individual was not currently authorized to execute this Flight Permit as he is not endorsed on the aircraft. Because it had not been sent to TC and needed to be, I completed a new Flight Permit form and transferred some of the old data ( Aircraft not on company OC , the flight  was for training purposes ) to the new form and submitted it to TC (john Stewart).  John Stewart advised that this permit could not be executed as NCA does not have authority to issue a Flight permit for an aircraft without it being on the AOC.  He advised me that we should record this deviation in our system.  \r\nI had thought SMS report was subitted Jan6/14 .\r\nSubmitted to day Jan09/2014\r\n",This was lack of attention to detail  and not knowing NCA had email stating Aircraft was on the AOC .which resulted in a flight permit be submittied to TC  and subsequently  was not required to be generated.

2284,14-01-03 17:00,BE 200,Crew- Duty Day (Unforeseen Circumstances),Maintenance (general),Occurrence,CAL4/CYEG,Low Risk,"After experiencing a maint delay in CAL4 (ref SMS report 2276) Dave and I inadvertently flew beyond our max duty day, in violation of CAR 700.16. Our total duty time was 15 hrs 42 min. We had split our day, but due to circumstances (outlined below) our normal 4 hrs 30 min split was reduced to 3 hrs 30 min. Splits must be a minimum of 4 hrs ref CAR 700.16(5)(b). We did not factor in the minimum split of 4 hours and planned our day with a 1 hr 45 min extension. In our minds we thought we were legal to continue to 15 hrs 45 min. \r\n\r\nUpon returning to base and entering duty times a violation message was generated. At that time we did not understand why and Dave forwarded the info to Deborah for clarification. After speaking with Deborah on Jan 7/14 we learned that our 3hr 30 min split did not qualify as a split, and we therefore exceeded our duty day by 42 min, with ops spec 93 allowing a max of 15 hrs.","Several factors led to this, not the least of which was the crew being unfamiliar with CAR 700.16(5)(b).\r\n\r\nDue to strong headwinds our flight to CAL4 took slightly longer than normal. Then, upon arrival in CAL4 we took a little while to get the plane set up for cold wx ops (commisary brought inside, engines plugged in, etc.) This delayed the normal start time of our split by approx 30 min.\r\n\r\nThe company responsible for transporting us to and from camp also requested that we depart 30 min early from camp due to the buses being busy with high volumes of people returning to camp from Christmas holidays. I calculated our max duty day based on a 3 hr 30 min split and informed the transport company that an early pick-up would be fine.\r\n\r\nThe times alone wouldn't have caused us to exceed our duty day. We would have been able to complete the scheduled flights in under 15 hrs and therefore not have required the split, which is usually the case on the Friday CAL4 flight. \r\n\r\nThe final factor was the maint issue (ref SMS 2276) which delayed us several hours.\r\n\r\nAfter learning of the maint issue, we had been carefully monitoring times through the afternoon as we knew we would be close to what we perceived to be our max duty day and were satisfied that we would be able to complete the day legally once the a/c was returned to service. Had we realized our split did not count we could have legally extended our day to 17 hours due to the unforeseen maint delay, however we did not exercise this option because we believed we were legal with the split.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, section 4.24 of the COM does not reference the 4 hr split requirements outlined in the CARs. This was not a factor though, as we did not reference the COM when determining our max duty day.\r\n\r\nNote: The original client was Canadian North, but the remainder of our flights had been tasked to serviceable a/c, so we were re-positioning home to CYEG with no pax. This is reflected in the trip report with the client indicated as NCA.\r\n\r\n","Jan.7 2014-4;21 pm yxj\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nFlight ops Q/A to determine risk.\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Jan 8 2014 11:25; handling risk low 1-5.

2361,13-12-26 10:45,None,Security Situation,,Occurrence,YYC airside gate 232,High Risk,"On the 27th Dec 2013 I was advised by TC Security Inspector Paulette Mcdonough that YYC airport authority roving secuirty patrol witnessed a BFI disposal truck driver existing through the airside access gate #232 at 1048(L).  The driver could not produce a RAIC and during the conversation the driver indicated that they had the access code.  \r\n\r\nA review of the facility security camera that views gate 232 it appears that a BFI Canada vehicle did open the gate at the access point by inputting the code (1045L) and did access the ramp to collect the garbage.

Meanwhile, I had Sebastien email the manufacturer (European based) to obtain the accurate lithium content so we would have it for the future.  \r\n\r\nThe manufacturer provided documentation on January 8, 2014 that showed the lithium content of the battery was actually 12 g and the package should have been fully regulated as per packing instruction 970 Section I.",I made a false assumption regarding the lithium content of the battery and authorized the shipment under section II of the packing instruction instead of holding the shipment and exploring other options (MEL Extension) that were available.,"Jan. 9 2014-9;00 am yxj\r\nVern Lace-Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nHandling risk high 4-4\r\n\r\nDavid Heiduk - SMS -05 Feb 2014 - 1025(L)\r\nCause determined to be single point human factor failure & a HF review is completed and attached.\r\nThe Originators were considered qualified and competent to perform the DG tasks at the time of this occurrence.\r\nPlease see the attached Human Factors worksheet attached for clarity.\r\nMy investigation has determined this report to be managed to As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP) under the circumstances and this paragraph constitutes a root-cause analysis.  This investigation reflects the cause as multiple human errors (3) beginning with a â€œdecision errorâ€ that resulted in a ruled based deviation that was not recognized by the originators which, subsequently, became an unintentional deviation from regulatory requirements.  Further, two preconditions contributed to the situation based on a self-imposed and perceived urgency that did not exist.  The originators attempted to determine the legitimacy of the shipment by engaging the TC DG Inspector, however, they did not exercise their responsibility to ensure compliance and based their decision on the comments of the Inspector and this resulted in a decision error that contributed to the unsafe act.  The originators were given appropriate training and procedures, but failed to carry out this task as required.  It has also been determined these decisions were not affected by an environmental influence, which could have contributed to the decisions made by the individuals.  The originators have self-reported this to record the regulatory deviation event and to allow the organization to review for improvement(s) and learning.

2291,14-01-08 18:00,B 1900D,Crew General,Operations procedures,Occurrence,CFN6,Medium Risk,"On Jan 7 we departed cyyc in CGNCE on an IFR flight plan to CFN6 (Primrose).  This was a pop up charter.  We had two Regional 1 mechanics on board to take to CFN6 and drop off then pick up 16 passengers for the return flight.  Extensive flight planning was required due to the load being at the limit, possibly over for the size of strip.  After the pre flight inspection of the aircraft was complete, there was still flight planning required.  Some of the planning was delegated to the first officer including the checking and printing of notams.  Kirby lake awos was called to obtain the current weather as primrose does not have an approach.  It was determined that the weather was sky clear below 12000ft.  North Cariboo OCC was also asked to obtain a strip report.  The strip was reported as braking action good from other 1900 and Dash8 aircraft that had been into the strip that day.  Along the with the strip report it was also reported as sky clear in Primrose as well. We received a list of passenger names and information on the destination airport that included various radio frequencies.  I believe this information was provided to OCC by Regional 1.  Before starting our decent into Primrose the plan for approach was briefed.  This included the frequency for the destination airport.  The information provided by OCC had this frequency, we checked it against the CFS. Both sources of information had 123.2 as the aerodrome traffic frequency.  After completing the approach briefing we radioed Kirby Lake for the latest weather. Upon being cleared out of controlled airspace by Edmonton center they advised us of traffic in the area to the north of our track.  We made a general traffic call on 126.7 with our intentions and talked to the aircraft. The approach plan was to utilise the initial approach fixes for RNAV Rwy 08 via SUXEG at Kirby Lake to descend to a safe IFR altitude from which we would proceed VFR if the conditions permitted.  Well before reaching SUXEG we were able to determine the weather was VFR. The plan was then to proceed from SUXEG direct to CFN6.Through out the decent calls were placed on 126.7 as well as 123.2. At one point we talked to another aircraft that had departed out of CET2.  At approx. 10 mile from the aerodrome we called on 123.2 with our intentions to over fly mid field and join a left hand downwind for landing. We tried to activate the arcal lighting system but the lights didn't come on, at the time this wasn't a major concern as it was day and sky clear VFR conditions. We then flew over head the runway and joined a downwind with calls being made on 123.2 upon joining final we made a final call as well as trying the lights again.  This time the lights came on and we landed.  After landing and taxiing in we shut down.  The temperature and wind were noted and it was determined that we could take all of the passengers and their bags directly back to CYYC. The appropriate calls were made to OCC and Edmonton Flight planning.  After exiting the aircraft to retrieve the passengers, I was approached by one of the airport staff (Diane I believe) and informed that we hadn't made any calls to the Unicom for Primrose operating on 122.95, she stated that the information contained in the CFS was incorrect and that there was a NOTAM with this updated frequency.  I then double checked the NOTAMs to discover that this was indeed the case.  We loaded the passengers and departed using 122.95 and 126.7 for departure calls and returned to CYYC. \r\n\r\nwritten by Jason Green",Due to the extensive planning required to meet the client request additional time was already spent.  Where normally I as captain would check or double check the NOTAMs personally prior to departure. The double checking of the NOTAM was not conducted.

Given that the airplane received maintenance for landing gear issues immediately upon landing in YYC, it is possible that an AME may have bumped the switch.

2307,14-01-14 15:00,None,Facilities,,Proactive Safety Observation,YEG facility,Low Risk,During Transport Canada Primary line Security Line Partner inspection today the inspector noted we have no restricted area signage for the access points (man doors and roll-up doors) on the outside of the building to access the hangar area. I am submitting the report as a proactive safety observation for tracking purposes to document the addition of signage.,"Lack of awareness for the requirement, we have previously identified the need for signage through out our facility from inside the facility to outside airside and to the hangar but didn't pickup on the need for signage for the access points from the outside groundside to access the hangar.","Jan. 14 2014-1524 yxj\r\nVern Lace Q.\\/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nHandling risk low\r\nAssigned to D.O.M.\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Jan 16 2014 11:40 handling risk low assigned to DOM.\r\n\r\nKen Pratt January 21, 2014- During a second meeting with the Transport Canada inspector on Monday Jan 20th, he suggested a solution, rather than identifying the hangar area a â€œRestricted Areaâ€, we could change the signage leading from the offices to the hangar from â€œRestricted Areaâ€ to â€œAuthorized persons onlyâ€. That way we donâ€™t have to identify the entire rest of the doors into the hangar as a restricted area. In the interim I taped over the restricted part of all the signs leading to the hangar from the offices so they just read â€œAuthorized Persons onlyâ€(new signs on order). Basically this is about care and control of the doors to access the restricted area, previously, we had identified the hangar as a restricted area and so if we were going part way, in Transportâ€™s eyes, we would need to go all the way and label all the doors, instead, we have now un-identified the four doors leading from the office to the hangar and so do not need all the other doors labeled restricted. The doors leading to outside onto the ramp is now the official restricted area line so as a secondary measure I added some better signage from the hangar doors leading to the ramp, see pictures. Our manual and training course cover off all the requirements for awareness by employees already and so all that was left was the signage. The Inspector was happy with this solution and the issues have been taken care of, recommending for closure.\r\n\r\nJan. 29 1014 \r\nJames Wakulchyk Q/A Manager Flt ops; I have reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found;\r\na.

2320,14-01-16 21:00,Ground Support Equipment,Ground Equipment,Maintenance Procedure,Occurrence,yeg hangar,Medium Risk,Went to use Blue genie lift and noted that the lift was very slow even though batteries indicated over 70%. I then noticed that the Aux power override switch had been lockwired in the override position. I cut the lockwire and hooked up power to the charger. I noticed that the current indicator on the charger was very erratic. I decided to check the batteries on the unit to see if there was any problems. the batteries had recently been serviced with distilled water. On the Right hand bank of batteries it was noted that the one battery was making an unusual sound internally. Battery charger unplugged and unit locked out at this time. ,overiding safety devices could have placed an unusual load on Battery causing failure. \r\nBattery could have overheated and/or exploded causing injury and damage.\r\n,"January 17 2013-8;35 AM yxj\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nIt appears that a system override switch was tampered with\r\nHandling risk MED-3-3\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Jan 17 2014 10:55 handling risk med 3-2 assigned to manager.\r\n\r\nKen Pratt February 11, 2014- Investigated and found out who lockwired the switch, spoke with him about common sense things like the fact it is a momentary switch, probably for good reason and if he doesnâ€™t know the reason, then he needs to research the reason. He argued that in order for him to use the lift, he had to lockwire the switch or else it was dangerous as you couldnâ€™t see where you were going. See his attached response. The switch is there in case of emergency, the main controller (circuit card) controls the lift and monitors battery voltage, when the battery voltage drops below a preset level, it wonâ€™t move, so the switch is there to get you down if you get stuck up at height, it will bypass the controller and all the safety features to give you a little more battery power to get down. It is not for continuous use. When questioned he seemed to think that this was the way it has been for â€œa while nowâ€. I checked the guidance in the course we have and there is no explanation of what the Aux power switch does, but it does say very clearly that if the machine is not working then you are to contact Maintenance and stop using it right away. It also says not to modify or change anything, so he was clearly acting outside any guidance we have given him. Continuing to use any piece of equipment with a workaround (Having to push the switch to make it work) is complacency and I believe there needs to be more awareness of what to do when there are equipment malfunctions. Iâ€™m recommending a Safety Bulletin be put out on awareness of broken equipment procedures for all Ramp and Maintenance. We replaced the batteries and charged the unit, it works as it should again.

The rudder lock was not engaged and I noticed the rudder was flapping around a bit violently. Dennis noticed as well and walked into the terminal to alert the crew of CGC. They stated to him that they had noticed it too but they could not engage the rudder lock because the cockpit flooring was covering the rudder lock hole. The crew of CGC still did not then make an attempt to install the rudder lock.\r\n\r\n,"This situation was caused by:\r\n1) The cockpit flooring not being installed correctly.\r\n2) The crew not being proactive by not lifting up the carpet to install the rudder lock.\r\n3) The crew not making an attempt to lock the rudder after being made aware of the issue.\r\n4) The crew not repositioning the aircraft into wind when they noticed the rudder flapping around.\r\n\r\nThere is a real danger of the rudder, its associated mounting and secondary structure being damaged in situations such as this.","Jan. 18 2014-1150 yxj\r\nVern Lace- Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nChanged to occurrence.\r\nThe fact that the rudder lock could not be installed because there was no access hole in the carpet was NOT entered in the log book.No Winair task card has been generated generated as of this date.\r\nSecondary investigator-Mark Wright assigned to investigate / rectify rudder lock access hole accessibility.\r\nHandling risk MED 3-3 due procedure not followed-Rudder lock not installed in windy conditions and not entering the difficulty with installing the rudder lock\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Jan 20 2014 handling risk med 3-2 assigned to manager.\r\n\r\nFeb 21 2014\r\nSpoke with captain.

The captain attempted to move the carpet, to access the rudder lock hole located in the floor, but was unsuccessful. The flight crew were leaving shortly (they were just waiting for the pax to arrive), so chose to leave the airplane as it was. \r\n\r\nDiscussed with captain the options he had - ask CBO (the airport operator) if he could reposition the airplane, see if they had a tug to move the airplane.

I noticed the airplane was still in hangar.  This was at a time of 1830 Zulu. at this point I went to look for a ramp attended to pull the plane out with no luck of finding anybody.  So I called Kevin Krestal my captain for the flight who was in dispatch area doing flight planning to ask Farouk to call someone to pull the plane out.  I continued to do my walk around and after 45 mins a time of 1915z the plane was still inside and nobody was around and we had to reposition to shell at 1930z.  I went in to dispatch and asked again nobody was around to pull it out.  At this point I pulled the airplane out with the tug to avoid a delay as we still needed fuel.  but before moving the airplane I ensured the park brake was off as we'll did a 360 walk around of the airplane to ensure nothing was in the way of  towing and continued to pull the aircraft out.  I stopped every couple feet and walked around the airplane to ensure all wings were clear and the plane would not hit anything.   No damage was done and no one was hurt.  ,No ramp or Maintenance personal available.  At this point I thought customer service was a priority in not being late.

On our descent into YEG on the first leg a passenger grabbed a motion sickness bag and became ill, he unbuckled himself and proceeded to the lavatory, he entered when we received the landing chimes and remained inside until we arrived at the NCA building.  He was not secured for landing. The pilots were made aware of what happened. The passenger wanted to remain on the aircraft and said he was feeling better so we continued on with our duties. The next leg we experienced turbulence to the point where I was only able to move about the cabin when we reached our cruising altitude. The pilots started the descent where we immediately hit turbulence again, I made an announcement to all passengers asking them to fasten their seat belts and stow their table trays. I was unable to conduct a cabin check and remained in the back jump seat for landing. The same passenger who became ill on the first leg once again unbuckled himself and proceeded into the lavatory for the remainder of the flight, I immediately notified the pilots who made a PA announcement for the passenger to remain in the lavatory until after landing. The turbulence was so bad that we felt it was safer for him to remain in the lavatory as opposed to trying to return to his seat and risk being injured. Multiple passengers needed to use motion sickness bags on our landing into Kirby Lake. Upon landing I made my way to the lavatory to check on the passenger, he said he was uninjured and returned to his seat. I did not receive his name or info.

When I opened the door he changed his mind and said he felt better and wanted to stay on the plane.\r\n\r\nIn YEG I told him it was unsafe for him to be out of his seat for landing and he apologized and said he needed to, it was beyond his control. We talked about the turbulence and I asked if he was hurt at all due to not being secured and he started cracking jokes saying it was fun and he is fine. When I asked him whether he wanted to deplane or not I didn't think it was going to happen again so I did not advise against it any further.\r\n\r\nI was stuck at the back of the plane upon arrival into Kirby Lake, the passenger once again entered the lav and Rob (Aerodrome worker) told me from a few rows up that a pax entered the lav, I told him I was aware and this is when the pilots made the announcement for him to remain in the lavatory.

After prepping the aircraft for the flight, the Captain consulted the CFS to determine if there was an RVOP/LVOP for the CYXT airport, and it was determined from the CFS and the Jepp Taxi Diagram that there was no programme in place for night operations, but that it was possible to taxi and depart during daylight hours with visibility as low as 1/4 mile.

Take off was conducted during daylight hours with reported visibiliity of 1/4 mile.  Flight proceeded without incident.

So I borrowed the company truck key and found the the truck covered with lots of snow just outside the lunchroom. The door was heavy and I must have used a bit too much energy to open it.  I think I expected it to stop at a 50/60 degree angle. But instead it swung open a bit to far and scratched the car that was parked right next to the truck. I started to write down my information to leave a note on his car. I asked Bonny (or Chris?) who soon found out that the owner's name is Eric Ma and left the note with her.\r\n\r\nThere were several horizontal scratches of about 2 cm length and the car door scratched his car at about an 80 degree angle.\r\n\r\nLater that day I stayed longer after work and filed a report but I must have taken too much time as I was walking back and forth finding out the license plate number and type of car so that the SMS report must have timed out even though I am sure that I successfully completed and submitted the report...\r\n\r\nEric Ma has a picture of the damage on his phone.,I misjudged the door's inertia.\r\nThe weight of the snow on the door may have played a role too.,"James Wakulchyk QA Flt ops Jan 27 2014 13:40 handling risk low 2-3 assigned to manager.\r\n\r\nSarah Bragg, Manager Customer Service - Jan 27, 2014 -  NCA employee, Eric Ma, has been advised of damage and took picture.

This was a knowledge based thinking error on his behalf, but in his defense, there is no guidance for OCC personnel on how to fill out these forms as the OCC personnel are usually only a go between to hunt down the Operations manager for a signature. He was told to sign it on behalf of John Green and he did what he thought was correct. The mistake should have been caught when the form arrived in YEG for insertion into the log book but it was not. The engineer that inserted the extension was counseled on ensuring the signatures and the information on the form was correct before entering the extension in the log book. He mentioned he knew that it had to be a Maintenance designate but he assumed that the Director of Maintenance in YYC had given Farouk permission to sign the spot and so he went ahead and entered the extension. We clarified that it had to be a Maintenance person who was the designate for the Director of Maintenance.

The flight from YMM to ER4 is approximately 10 minutes. As additional information, on the first arrival into Mildred Lake, the flight crew called approximately 5 minutes before commencing the approach, commencing the approach, at the Intermediate approach waypoint (where they turned the runway lights on), at the final approach waypoint, and again on short final. For the second arrival, conditions were VMC. The flight crew called approximately 10 minutes prior to arriving at the aerodrome, as well as when Centre switched them to enroute frequencies. The flight crew set up for the RNAV approach, and flew this for a straight in approach. The flight crew called again at IKLAK, the Intermediate waypoint (10.2 miles final) and turned the runway lights on at this point. They then called on final, and when clear of the runway.\r\n\r\nAfter landing both times in ER4, no one approached him to discuss the issue.\r\n\r\nThe captain has been to ER4 now 3 times, and has never had a response when broadcasting on 122.95.

After we landed in Naniamo, and deplaned passengers  I started walking back to the plane and I could see a light fog like smoke coming from the port side landing gear and as I got closer the smoke started thickening into a black smoke get larger and there was a burning smell in the air. The ramp attendant and Steve Chlan were outside observing this (obviously concerned) and when it became worse Steve instructed me to grab a fire extinguisher, I ran in the aircraft and took the forward fire extinguisher, and passed it to Steve. He then asked for a flashlight and I ran back inside the aircraft and passed it off, I then went inside the terminal building to try to find Steve's wife and inform her of the situation as she was there waiting for the plane to catch it to YYC. Steve received an injury during the time I was gone (which I believe there is another flight report about) When I came back out to the A/C after about 10 minutes later the smoke was gone and the fire extinguisher was unused. We all gathered as a crew, debriefed and made sure we were all fine, understood what happened during the day, were comfortable with the way we handled it and calmed down a little as we were all very shocked by the events that we witnessed. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\nBraeden Friesen\r\n\r\nFeb.19 2014 J Wakulchyk Q/A Mgr.

The journey log was reviewed for the date in which oil was last added to either engine. There was no record of any oil being added to either engine in the entirety of the journey log. We called YEG maint to see when the last time they added oil. They suggested that we motor the engine to see if a valve in the engine oil system was stuck shut - making it seem as if there was no oil. Upon completing the motoring we found a puddle of oil approx 12 inches by 16 inches around the tire.  We requested an engineer from Canadian north to come over and help us locate the leak (he is qualified on dash-8's). There was still no oil showing on the sight gauge. He determined that the ecology can was full and that was most likely the source of the leak. After speaking with bill and jay in YYC maint he drained the ecology can and added 4 quarts in the #1 engine and 2 quarts in the #2 engine we ran the engines and did a leak check there was small amount of oil coming out of the cowl drain so we dropped the cowling cleaned up the small amount of oil that was spilled during the refilling processes and motored it again.

2355,14-02-04 15:00,RJ-100,Ramp/Parking/Maneuvering,,Occurrence,CYMM ramp,Medium Risk,Part A:  marshalled into a 'T' just SE of the Executive office building.  One marshaller with no wing guidance and an Astar helicopter parked on the north side of the apron area.  Following the marshaller would have resulted in impact between our right wing tip and the tail of the Astar.  I had to stop and gesture to the marshaller that we would not proceed until he was positioned at an observer position for the right wing.  This moved us south and clear of the helicopter.

2362,14-02-08 8:30,737 All Types,Third Party Actions ,,Occurrence,YYc Ramp ,Low Risk,"Canadian North Boeing 595  was operating flight 1400 in the far west boeing spot. An Air Georgian 1900 pulled in and parked perpendicular to 595. They kept their engines running for a prolonged period of time. I would guess more than 10 minutes. The prop wash was blasting the Boeing from a pretty close distance. The fuel truck parked in between the 1900 and the boeing so as to block some of the wind. Once i was finished loading the bags onto the aircraft I was heading back to grab the rest of the bags. As I drove around the fuel truck ( between it and the 1900) the prop wash peeled the piece of 4' by 8' plywood out of the baggage cart, threw it over the fuel truck clearing it. As it came down it narrowly missed the fueller ( Clayton Rowe)  bounced off the ground and stuck the engine nacelle of the Boeing. I Immediately informed CDN North maintenance ( Goran Rudas)  of what happened and they inspected for any damage. I checked with the fueller if he was alright.  Once the 1900 shut down I informed the captain ( Nick Woods Amus)  of what happened. He said they weren't pulling any power but they were having mechanical issues so that is why they kept their engines running.  They had at one point shut down engine one but they had restarted it at the time of the incident. Flight 1400 left on time without any further incident.

2364,14-02-09 17:00,Ground Services,Aerodrome - Standards and procedures,Aerodrome - Staffing,Proactive Safety Observation,CRL4 Ramp,Medium Risk,"On Thursday Feb 6,2014 There were 9 North Cariboo Air Planes on the ramp in Kirby Lake. This is far too many aircraft for the ramp space available. To make all the aircraft fit we have to overlap wings as well as clear snow and park aircraft in the grass on the side of the runway. The number of aircraft arriving on Thursdays has almost doubled in the last year and it has stretched the available ramp space to and beyond its limits. \r\n\r\nThe other major issue I see with this many aircraft is the lack of available man power to deal with all of these arrivals safely. with only 4 people working the ramp on arrivals and 3 for departures we never seem to have enough people to satisfy all the safety requirements. It has to be noted that the ramp staff in CRL4 have to do snow removal, Fuel, Marshall, Deice and run all other forms of ground support equipment, as well as having to take the time to fill out Devon Specific paperwork.\r\n\r\nWe have seen an aircraft wing tip hit a light post on a day where there was very little ramp space congestion.

The infield was utilized for additional parking in conjunction with aircraft on the ramp due to space availability, which is fully out of our control. Later arrivals (back-up aircraft) with limited parking were positioned safely via TUG to their parking positions. 9 aircraft was also a â€˜one offâ€™ for Kirby. This occurred due to dispatch utilizing two aircraft for YXT/YXS due to duty issues\r\n\r\nâ€¢	To clarify- there is no wing over wing occurring at Kirby Lake. This is pertaining to staggered wings to maximize efficiency and spacing using marshallers/wing-walkers at all times)\r\n\r\nâ€¢	We now have the Q400 operational. This immediately reduced the amount of aircraft required to obtain the required lift on certain runs. As an example, today we have 6 aircraft as opposed to our almost standard 8. The ultimate effects of the Q400 in service, especially with more coming online, will continue to increase efficiency for Southbound flights. We now have the tree obstacles cut down on the approach paths for both RWY 08 & 26. CBR Tech are up today to survey and re-assess the obstacles, and itâ€™s likely that NCA will have new data next week. We would anticipate Dash 300â€™s lift to dramatically increase, which will further mitigate the requirement for back-up aircraft to support lift out of Kirby Lake.  \r\n\r\nâ€¢	To this comment regarding manpower, we now have an additional supervisor. The two supervisors shift in/out on Thursdayâ€™s, which gives us an additional person on the ramp for arrivals/departures, with both supervisor here every Thursdays for extra help. I am ALWAYS available to help when needed as well, and do so often. This is in effect now, and has increased our efficiency and manpower issues on Thursdayâ€™s. Itâ€™s widely advertised and known amongst aircrews, that we can only dispatch one aircraft at a time for obvious reasons. Crews understand and know that a level of patience is required on Thursday departures as we have limited space, no taxiways, and boarding protocol to follow.\r\n\r\nâ€¢	Devon has also committed to creating a new position to manage some client services, as well as check-in at Kirby Lake on Thursdays. This will further increase ramp staff, as we can then utilize our personnel outside as opposed to dedicating staff for check-in.\r\n\r\nâ€¢	When operations are hampered by poor weather or additional flights creating more workload, our daily safety meeting with staff clarify additional items for the day, as well as all Kirby staff are made to understand that safety is paramount, and work should be deliberate/slow/and calculated to reduce safety concerns. We are under a considerable amount of pressure to dispatch flights in a timely manner, but not at the expense of safety. Our client understands our challenges here, and will not accept rushing in multi complex operational conditions. I think itâ€™s well understood that the situation is not often perfect, but with the proper planning and thought process to reduce rushing, we can manage the Thursday workload into Kirby Lake, especially considering our obstacles being lowered in conjunction with the Q400. Some recent changes as indicated above will cause some of this report to become moot.\r\n\r\nâ€¢	The wing tip strike incident has been closed with preventative measures in place. This addition to the SMS merely resurrects an incident that in my mind is closed. Regardless whether it was ultimately deemed the responsibility of Kirby staff or error by the PIC at the time, itâ€™s not reflective of todayâ€™s Kirby operation. However, it is always discussed as a possibility if protocol is not followed, and is tracked closely. Trevor was not on shift when this incident occurred, and likely wasnâ€™t privy to ensuing investigation/results. \r\n\r\nâ€¢	I would recommend using the Q400, obstacle clearing, and additional supervision as a platform in order to close this report.\r\n\r\n-John Green- VP Ops- 10 March 2014- investigation will stay open pending results of obstacle data and new flight schedule including Q400 and increased capacity of Dash 8 aircraft \r\n\r\n-John Green VP Ops- 04 April 2014- Q400 aircraft in service revised obstacle survey has eliminated 2-3 aircraft on a scheduled basis depending on the week thereby reducing congestion on Thursdays.

The windshield heat was turned on just after take-off, and left on for the duration of the flight. The incident occurred approximately 5 minutes after the cruise checks were completed. Once realizing the windshield had cracked, the captain directed the FO (who was PM) to put his goggles on; he then put his own on. He then called for the checklist. \r\n\r\nThe captain's decision to put the goggles on was due to concern over his and the FO's eyesight, should particles come free from the windshield. Although they determined that the outer ply was cracked, they chose to leave the goggles on as an extra safety barrier. \r\n\r\nThe passengers were briefed after the checklist had been completed.

The plane was stopped at the intersection and a progressive taxi was asked to the tower. We were told to turn on Y/B and continued south because it was the only sign we could see and were immediately instructed to do a 180. and continue to C. Directions were followed and we continued to the holding bay.

We had the taxi map with us. we initially got instructions from ground , looked at the map and determined where we were to go. I have never been to this area of the airport before and Chris said he was familiar. so when we go to the intersection I started my turn in the correct direction. Chris instructed me to stop and go another way. At this point I stopped and made another turn in the wrong direction.  There I stopped again. Then requested a progressive taxi from the tower to ensure we were not to go on a restricted taxi way. At that point we continued on to the holding bay to do our ground runs. At no point did ground say that we were on a restricted taxi way. On the way back , all I can think of is that we made a wide turn onto Mike, as we were no very diligent and aware of where we were going.",". Did we not do the correct thing by stopping and asking for a progressive taxi to not interfere with any aircraft ground movement.

The flight crew did retard the power lever (as part of their normal operations after the go-around, not as a trouble shooting tool), and did not get the horn. Despite this lack of evidence that the gear was unsafe, the flight crew elected to conduct a manual gear extension.\r\n\r\nBoth crew members counselled regarding tools at their disposal in order to aid in troubleshooting possible gear unsafe situations.

Furthermore we never made the arrangement to fuel with passengers on board the aircraft, as we were caught off guard having never given a fuel order yet.\r\n\r\nwe could not run out to stop the fueler cause the flight deck doorway was blocked by Brian and all the passengers that were leaving the aircraft for the buses. so we made a radio call to the unicom operator to stop the fueling process as we could not exit the aircraft with the line of passengers in the doorway at the time.\r\n\r\nwhen we finally got a fuel load i was told by both the unicom and fueler that they were going to bring the fuel to 4000lbs as that's what it has been the last few times. even without a fuel order from any flight crew members",assuming what the fuel would be without confirming what the fuel requirements were with the flight crew as this was the normal fuel that was being added on for the flight because they were trying to get the aircraft turned around quickly.\r\n\r\ndoing so created a safety issue where fueling was taking place without a safety briefing to the passengers.\r\n,"Feb 27 2014 1319 yyc\r\nVern Lace-Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nQ/A Flight ops to determine risk.\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Feb 27 2014 15:10 handling risk med due to third party actions (no RCA required).

2389,14-02-27 16:00,DHC-8,Crew/Passenger Interference,Cabin/Passengers,Occurrence,in flight in the cabin,Medium Risk,"Before we took off out of Peace River Dave helped him self to some potato chips out of the overhead bin. I gave him a look of disapproval but decided to not say anything about it to him as I thought tomato it was not important. After we took off I noticed that he had made quite a mess in his seat (it looked as if he crunched up all the chips in the bag and then tried to eat them in front of a fan) they were everywhere (on the seat and floor and seat beside him). Again I decided to not make any comments about it because I was busy and needed to get service started. after I finished service and began to do the snack service I noticed that he had again made a mess with his snack that I gave him with his drink (Krispy Kernles- Sunny Mix). There were pretzels and other various snack items on the floor and his seat. Again I didn't say anything to him about it. I then noticed he moved 2 seats back, away from the mess. After hearing the 2 bells for landing I did my announcement and went to do a cabin check, upon doing a cabin check I noticed that this passenger (Dave Hopkins) was holding something between his legs as if he was trying to hide it and when I asked him to do his seat belt up he attempted to do so with one hand. I then asked the man what it was in his hand, he told me it was pop. I then asked him if he was holding an alcoholic beverage, he again told me it was a pop. I asked one more time if he had a beer in his hand and he once again told me it was pop. As he was lying to my face I feel like he had a smug look on his face which angered me. I then asked him to hand me the beverage, he hesitated but after a couple seconds gave up the Coors. After having the beer in my hand I asked him what his name was he also hesitated with this but did end up giving me his name. Although I felt as though he was giving me a wrong name (he seemed to have to think really hard about what his name was, which is why I thought it was wrong, but I suppose he was maybe just a little intoxicated). I then proceeded to ask the gentleman sitting behind him (who Dave was quite chatty with the whole flight) if he knew this man, he looked an his shoes and told me no. \r\nI then finished up with my cabin check and called the pilots to inform them what was going on, we were below 10,000ft so i just gave them a quick heads up and they called me back when we were taxiing in. \r\nMatt Dunning then told me to ask the man to remain seated until everyone was off the flight so that they could speak with him.

I asked her if they were drinking at the bar in the main terminal (most passengers go drink there when we are delayed) and she said that they seemed to be okay, they were walking to the back of the aircraft and shouting at the other passengers...I asked her if she was sure because I didn't want to be dealing with drunk passengers and she said they were fine. I warned the pilots about them and said i would let them know if they became an issue. We took off on our YMM-YEG leg and when I walked to the back of the aircraft to begin my service passenger John Steel started making comments about taking off my coat to see what I had going on underneath it. I ignored these comments and started my service. A passenger relocated himself after takeoff due to how obnoxious the passengers were being. Mark Barkley finished his snack and threw all of his garbage on the ground, i asked him to pick it up and told the 3 passengers (the 4th sat at the front and did not cause any issues) that Conoco as well as NCA had a zero tolerance for drugs and alcohol and if they kept being disrespectful that I would be reporting them. Mark apologized and said he wanted to make it up to me....he proceeded to pull out his phone and show me a picture of him taking a dump in a urinal....I called the pilots to let them know the passengers were being ridiculous and that I wasn't going to do flight deck service because i felt uncomfortable opening the door with the way these guys were acting.  David Tuthill pulled out his cell phone and started asking me to take pictures with them, i told them no it was inappropriate and he kept trying to take pictures of me in the galley, I told him to put his phone away, he put it away and got up to use the lavatory and came out with pee all down his pant leg, I told him to take his seat because I had to being my landing duties. I made my taxi in announcement and John Steel stood up and went into the back galley, I immediately grabbed the PA and said once again remain seated until the seat belt sign has been turned off..he returned to his seat and stood up again a few moments later, I released myself from the jump seat and went to the back of the plane to tell him to sit down...he turned around and was covered in vomit. I told him to take his seat and then went to call the pilots. When we arrived at the FBO I opened the door and let all YEG passengers off but positioned myself in the aisle and made the 3 passengers show me their work ID's so i could report them. Richard Milton was standing behind me in case i need help. After a few minutes of arguing I got their names and told them to have a good day.

2397,14-03-04 20:30,737 All Types,Check-In Procedures,Technology and Architecture,Occurrence,Our ramp- Apron 2,Medium Risk,"When Enerjet called in this evening they said they had a passenger discrepancy and that they counted 86 but IBS was saying 87. Anyhow we went and took a roll call on Enerjet when it arrived and 86 YYC pax were all accounted for. Then we took off Dustin Airey, Trevor Buell, Matthew Haller, and Trevor Noseworthy and placed them on NCE to YMM.\r\nBecause the Aircraft was almost 90 min late coming into YEG we could not cut off our flight until they arrived and when they finally did arrive, we had 3 go-shows added on last minute ( all with luggage) plus the 10 Newalta bags that were arranged to go on from the earlier flight.\r\nThe pilots did a tally and everything was all good.\r\nNow when we usually board Conoco, there are usually multiple aircrafts leaving in close proximity so we usually check off all the pax ID and look at their boarding passes because in the past weâ€™ve had a problem with pax trying to switch A/C. We do this 99.9% of the time but because there were ONLY a handful of Surmont 1 pax left in the building to board only ONE other aircraft, I did not find it necessary to match up IDâ€™S to boarding passes. On my IBS it said I only had 63 pax but I counted 66 boarding passes when we boarded. I refreshed all our screens and it came out the same that we had 63 in the system but 66 that boarded. When we looked closer we realized that IBS had deleted boarding pass numbers 62, 63, and 64. \r\nWe sent some agents back out to do another YEG roll call on the A/C. We were going to write down the 3 YEG names that were not called out and re- add them to the system but halfway through the rollcall the pilot radioed me and said to stop the roll call, that he had the right amount of people (149 pax), and that he was good to go. The flight attentants were also being incredibly rude saying these roll calls were a waste of their time and that we were being a hassle. So our agents came back inside without being able to finish the final YEG rollcall so we did not find out the names of the deleted 3 passengers on Engejet making up the 148 passengers that should have been on board. \r\n**86 YYC minus 4 onto NCE= 82 YYC plus 66 YEG= 148 final pax count that should have deplaned in YMM. **\r\n",Obviously having IBS act up on us not only in YEG but in YYC added to the confusion.\r\nI guess if i had still printed off a manifest for those few Edmonton pax and still checked them off one by one as they boarded i would have caught that IBS mistake a lot quicker and i could have called reservations right away with the three names they needed to re-add to the flight list.,"March 5 2014-1655 yxj\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nFlight ops Q/A to determine risk\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Mar 6 2013 11:10 handling risk med 2-4 assigned to manager RCA required.\r\n\r\nPaulette Buckley Manager, Edmonton Operations April 22, 2014 - Upon Analysis we have found the root cause to be a technical glitch beyond our control with the IBS program.

We received a call from Edm Center NCB 9780 now 12 and 02 open We replied  We'll stick with 02 for NCB 9780\r\nWe were then passed on to Edm arrivals 120.5\r\nInitial contact with Edm arrivals  Edm arrivals hello it's NCB 9780 checking in we've been cleared down to 10 000 and planing rwy 02\r\nEdm arrivals replied NCB 9780 you were told 30 minutes ago rwy 12\r\nWe replied ok we'll switch to rwy 12 NCB 9780\r\nWe then flew the arrival for 12 and received a call from Edm arrivals NCB 9780 cleared down to 6000\r\nWe replied leaving 8000 for 6000 now NCB 9780\r\nNo reply from Edm arrivals to say correct or incorrect, this is normal as the frequency was very busy. Note: (during this decent we were not called about a deviation from our altitude)\r\nAs we continued down to 6000 at about 6400 we were called by Edm arrivals NCB 9780 you are now cleared down to 6000, but I see you are already (or almost there)\r\nWe replied I did read back leaving 8000 for 6000\r\nEdm arrivals replied  I'll pull the tapes.  We replied thank you\r\nA few moments later Edm arrivals NCB 9780 company was cleared down to 6000 and you were told to standby for lower. (We do not recall this and did not acknowledge such a call with a read back).\r\nWe replied ok we realize there was some sort of confusion there (I can't remember the wording on this call but we did acknowledge so sort of miscommunication). \r\n",Edm arrivals 120.5 was very busy due to Wx in CYEG\r\n\r\nMore than one other company on frequency - call signs were not similar \r\n\r\nPossible calls overlapping or blocked calls?,"Andrew Matson - SMS - March 9, 2014  1200L\r\nCADORS report attached to file.\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Mar 10 2014 - handling risk high potential infraction CARs 602.31 assigned to mgr.\r\n\r\nMarch 10 2014-0902 yxj\r\nVern Lace-Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nHandling risk as per flight ops Q/A\r\n\r\nMarch 13 2014\r\nDeborah Kominko Assistant Chief Pilot 703/704\r\nSpoke with captain on the day of the occurrence. Called the Shift Manager at YEG Centre. After he had reviewed the tapes, he called me back to discuss his findings. It was discovered that the clearance issued to descend from 8000 to 6000 was for a different NCA flight - NCA 1593 - but 9780 read back this clearance at the same as 1593. The calls were blocked. The YEG controller re-cleared 1593 from 8000 to 6000 which they read back. The YEG controller then told 9780 will have lower in 3 miles. There was no response from 9780. As 9780 descended, the controller came on with 9780, I see you descending - now cleared to 6000. 9780 replied - we read back out of 8 for 6 to which the reply from ATC was we'll pull the tapes. \r\n\r\nIt was clear from the tapes that 9780 believed they had received a clearance to descend, but in fact that clearance was for another airplane. The mistake was not clearly corrected by ATC, as the response I'll have lower for you in 3 miles could be interpreted to mean lower than 6000. Although the frequency was congested, there were no other factors that played a role in this incident.\r\n\r\nThis is a Human Factors Error, of the type Thinking Error - knowledge based mistake;Action is carried out, as planned, using  conscious thought processes, but wrong course of action is taken: â€˜do the wrong thing believing it to be rightâ€™; using incorrect information.\r\n\r\nIn review, the impact to safety management and the likelihood of reoccurrence is determined to be low.  This investigation has been reviewed and determined to be managed to As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP), and meets the SMS requirements for a root cause analysis.  The cause has been determined to be a human error and unintentional deviation from a single standard, procedure or process.

The After Takeoff Checklist had been completed as per usual and all flight parameters were otherwise observed to be normal.  During the later stages of the climb, I (Corey - PF) noticed that the three landing gear lights appeared to be faintly on.  However, this was barely noticeable as the sun was shining directly onto the instrument panel.  After blocking the sunlight with my hand, we confirmed that the three green lights were in fact on, despite the landing gear handle being in the retracted position and no red lights on.  The QRH was consulted, but there was no applicable guidance for this situation.  All circuit breakers were still in.  The landing gear handle was then cycled down and back up, with no change to the three green lights (i.e., they stayed on).  Calgary Maintenance was then consulted by radio.  The decision was subsequently made in consultation with them and OCC, to divert to CYEG, as the aircraft had, by this time, proceeded northward towards our destination, Conklin/Leismer (CET2).  ATC was contacted and the necessary clearance was received for the requested diversion to CYEG.  The passengers were advised, in general terms, of the situation (with assurance given that the landing gear was in a safe condition for landing), and that the aircraft would be landing at CYEG.  The indicated airspeed did not exceed the Max Landing Gear Extended speed (180 KIAS) from the point of takeoff at CYYC to the point of landing at CYEG.  The arrival at CYEG was completed safely and without incident.\r\n\r\nDuring the diversion, ATC asked about the reason for our diversion and if assistance was required.  They were advised of the nature of the gear malfunction (with confirmation given that the landing gear was down and locked), and that assistance was not required.

No common factors identified within NCA control.  \r\n\r\nThis report has also exposed a weakness in the calculation of the statistics used for measuring progress related to SMS Goals.  The resetting of the Year to Date stats on January 1st of each year does not provide an accurate rate of injury or damage as the changes to the hours worked (divisor in the calculation) are too varied from month to month.  This weakness was presented to the SMS Committee at the March 2014 and the requirement to enter a proactive report for exceeding the threshold set in the SMS goal related to damage has been removed due to insufficient historical data to effectively change the statistical.  The statistical calculation related to injuries is currently under review with Senior Management to determine the most effective means of tracking.  \r\n\r\nAs this is a proactive report followup date changed to May 14, 2014 in accordance with the SMS Manual.\r\n\r\nAndrew Matson - SMS - April 29, 2014  1245L\r\nReviewed KPI calculation with General Manager.  Injury calculation related to goals will now be the total number the disabling injuries incurred over the previous 12 months divided by the total number of manhours worked over the previous 12 months.  This calculation better shows the rate of disabling injuries incurred in the workplace, without the excessive variance in the divisor.  New graph presented to SMS Committee at the April 24, 2014 Special Meeting with the recommendation that the SMS Objective related to injuries be amended to read Sustain a 12 month disabling injury rate per manhour of below 0.0000130 (equivalent to 1 disabling injury per 85,000 manhours).  This represents a 5% reduction in the maximum disabling injury rate from the current maximum rate of 1 disabling injury per 80,000 manhours.  General Manager requested that the requirement for a High Risk proactive safety report be generated as a result of exceeding this threshold be removed from the Objective as an increase in the disabling rate is not enough evidence to justify the identification of a trend within the system.  Instead, there are sufficient means of trend analysis and tracking already present within the system.  This request was accepted by the SMS Committee at the April 24, 2014 meeting.

2426,14-03-22 16:00,Ground Support Equipment,Ground Equipment,,Occurrence,on the ramp in front of hangar 3,Medium Risk,I was using the low boy tug to move aircraft and had to get off to open hangar two. I put the tug into neutral with the park brake on and waited a few seconds to ensure it was not going to roll. I went into hangar two to open the door and when I came out of the hangar the tug had reversed into the door of hangar three. The hangar door has a dent on the bottom near the right side of the man door. For the rest of the time that I used that tug I chalked the wheels before walking away from the tug. \r\n\r\nWe have had similar incidents' with this tug in the past as we are unable to put it into park and the park break doesn't always work sufficiently. When the tug is in neutral it will occasionally slip into reverse or drive if it is left for a few minutes. ,The tug had the gear shifter fixed a few weeks ago so that we would be able to put it into park but it wasn't fixed properly. We need it to be re done so that the tug will go into park and to have the park break fixed so that we can rely on it to hold the tug in place.,"James Wakulchyk QA Mgr Flt Ops Mar 24 2014 14:20 handling risk med process fail 2-4 assigned to mgr\r\n\r\nMarch 24 2014 1536 yxj\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nHandling risk MED 3-2 \r\n\r\nTrevor Smith Senior Supervisor, Airports April 4, 2014\r\nUpon investigation it was found that the low boy tug had a unserviceable emergency brake as well as the problem with the transmission shifter. This prompted a deeper investigation of all GSE in both YEG and YYC. It was discovered that all brakes were working on the GSE, with the exception of all 3 of the YYC aircraft tugs.\r\n\r\nIn response to this finding a daily inspection for all GSE has been developed that includes both a brake check and an emergency brake check. With a proper working emergency brake this will eliminate the possibility of a tug driving away with out a driver even if the vehicle does slip into drive.\r\n\r\nProbable Cause/RCA\r\nI have determined this to be an mechanical/equipment failure. With the Addition of the new Daily Inspection sheets for the ramp, I have deemed this to be As Low As Reasonably Possible (ALARP). Daily inspections will test the serviceability and function of the  E-brake.\r\n\r\nSide note, separate from this investigation,\r\nThe aircraft tug that was involved in this incident is close to 40 years old. although, it has been rebuilt numerous times it, in my opinion is in need of being replaced.

Steven returned the signal by pointing to the #1 engine and spinning his wand. The Fight Crew put there head down and began there start procedures but rather than starting engine #1 the crew attempted to start #2. The Servisair crew that was manning the air start cart, in the vicinity on engine #2, quickly ran toward the nose of the 737 and they, as well as the Lead marshaler all began to signal to cut the start on engine #2. Once the flight crew noticed all the cut signs they acknowledged that they had spun the wrong engine. The flight crew then re signaled to start #1, started it normally. The air start cart and the GPU were then disconnected and the #2 engine was started and the aircraft taxied out. \r\n\r\nCopy of video on file in the SMS office\r\n\r\nThird party actions.\r\n\r\nAll Ramp Staff acted with in their ramp guidance and ramp directives.\r\n\r\nSeparate from this investigation I believe that there is a training opportunity here with air starts.

2430,14-03-24 8:00,CL601,Ramp/Parking/Maneuvering,,Occurrence,CYYC RAMP,Medium Risk,"Taxiing into the North Cariboo Ramp from the east entrance , Marshaller directed me on a line which would have either made contact with the left wing,  or come dangerously close,  to a piece of Canadian North ground equipment ( Air start cart). The Cart was parked farther from Hanger 6 than was safe ( beyond yellow hash marks which extend from the front of the building). I elected to line the aircraft up on a more northerly line so that the left wing tip was not in close proximity to the air start cart.","Lack of care,  or unaware , that this equipment was farther from the building than was safe when marshalling the 601 to a normal parking spot. Additionally I do not believe that CYYC ramp personnel receive proper marshalling training in that I have never in 7 years of employment with NCA received any directional marshalling instructions, ie wand movement that gives proper turning instructions. The marshallers simply stand with the wands in a manner to line up on them, also rarely do I ever see wing walkers, if there had been in this particular case it would have been extremely obvious that the Cart was creating a hazard.In my opinion pilots still must provide their own visual scan at all times whenever maneuvering and being marshalled on the Calgary Ramp due to the observations made above.","James Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Mar 25 2014 15:50 handling risk med 3-2 assigned to manager.

I have now come up with at Parking Policy for all GSE in YYC, wich will ensure that GSE does not get parked in any area where it will affect aircraft operations on the NCA YYC ramp.\r\nAll GSE will now be parked along the blast fence along the east end of the ramp. there is to be nothing parked on the ramp unless it is connected to or in the process of servicing an aircraft. This will eliminate the possibility of a GSE aircraft conflict.\r\nWith the marshaling coming into question I want to emphasize that it is always the pilots responsibility for the safe maneuvering of the aircraft at all times. If the PIC feels that something is at risk of contacting the aircraft they are to stop the aircraft and motion for a marshaller to check for proper clearance. That being said with the re issuance of the updated ramp manual there is now very clear and concise instructions for marshaling aircraft with very clear instructions on signals for both ramp agents as well as pilots. If all marshaling is done to the levels required in the ramp manual this will eliminate GSE and wing clearance issues as well.\r\n\r\nRCA-No parking plan for GSE which allowed GSE to be left in an area which affected aircraft operations.\r\nRCA-Marshaller did not have a wing walker, Single point failure, marshaller should have held the aircraft until such time as another wing walker was able to get out side to help with the arrival.\r\n\r\nSince this incident new ramp manual has been issued which covers proper arrival procedures of aircraft\r\n\r\nApril 23. 2014 James Wakulchyk Q/A Manager Flt ops; I have reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found;\r\na.

After departure, as the aircraft reached cruising altitude, they contacted NCB Operations and told them they would go to CYOW rather then YWG.\r\n\r\nNo consultation was made with the Dispatcher responsible for the flight, to discuss required fuel, enroute weather, new alternates, new flight levels, and new routing.\r\n\r\nWhen the dispatcher was informed, second hand, of the change, they ran the numbers for a flight from CYYC to CYOW.  The flight was NOT possible legally with the closest available alternate, CYMX.  The flight was run from CYYC-CYOW as a no alternate flight, and was found to require 19,161 lbs of fuel to meet CARS requirements.  The flight had called 19,000 lbs as their departure fuel.  This would mean, potentially, that the flight was short 161 lbs of fuel to make it a legal flight plan.\r\n\r\nThe dispatcher contacted CZWG center and relayed the fuel numbers to the aircraft via the enroute controller, and suggested that if they did not meet the requirements for fuel that the flight should return to its original flight plan, and land in YWG for a fuel stop.  Because the aircraft in question has no sat phone, the dispatcher could not contact the plane directly and had to rely on communications relay by trained ATC professionals.  The dispatcher never received verbal confirmation of this message being received by the pilots of NCB 9131 but the aircraft changed its destination again, and landed in YWG, according to the original operational flight plan.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence represents a loss of co-authority dispatch and the potential for a safety issue to develop.","Co-Authority dispatch training, or NCB policies do not stress enough the shared nature of the responsibility for the safety of the flight between the PIC and the Dispatcher running the flight.  Changes to an operational flight plan should be discussed between the pilot in command and the dispatcher.

Ryan Kuemper discussed that chocking the inside wheel of the 737's is a safer approach and thatâ€™s how NCA would like to see it done from this point on. There have been minor instances in the past with attendants hitting their heads on the gear door, now everyone in Calgary is aware that they are to be chocking the inside wheels on the main gear for all 737.\r\nInside main gear chocking procedure for 737 has also been confirmed to be in use in YEG.\r\n\r\nI consider the current mitigations and safety barriers which are currently in place to be effective.  The impact to safety is low and the likelihood of reoccurrence is unlikely.  My investigation has determined this report to be managed to As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP), and this paragraph constitutes a root-cause analysis.  My investigation reflects the cause as a human error or a â€œaction errorâ€ which resulted in a ruled based deviation, which was not recognized by the individual, subsequently, becoming an unintentional deviation from a standard procedure; the individual was given appropriate training and procedures, however, was injured carrying out the task as required.  It has also been determined this decision was not affected by an external, or environmental influence, which could have contributed to the decisions made by the individual.  Due to injury the originator has self-reported this deviation to record the event and to allow the organization to review for possible improvement and learning.   The report has been reviewed with the originator and they have been made aware of the significance of this event.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this event, a review was conducted of the ground handling procedure differences between NCA and Canadian North practices and my risk assessment  (NCA Risk 1-2 Canadian North Risk  3-2) leads me to believe that all ramp operations involving this type of aircraft should follow the NCA practices as they appear to reflect a greater level of safety assurance.\r\nThis investigation reveals probable cause or root cause as a human failure determined to be an â€œaction error.â€\r\nI am recommending this report for closure.\r\n\r\nApril 15. 2014 \r\nJames Wakulchyk Q/A Manager Flt ops; I have reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found;\r\na.

This was flagged by me in Tech. Records, and confirmed by Dagmar Gunn Tech. Records, and I immediately informed Mark Wright the YYC Base Manager of the issue and he worked with his crew to have the over due prop blade replaced that evening. However FLSX did fly with the overdue blade before this was caught on Apr 7, 2014, accumulating approx. 13.5 FH and 11 FL.","The blade in question (PN SFA13U1P0A SN 888062-7) was previously installed on C-FLSX, installed on Jan 25, 2007, it was then removed Jan 15, 2013 for damage on the blade tip [Ref TC 132277-15]. At the time of its removal there was still 1 year remaining before the blade would be due for its major inspection. The blade was sent out for repair and certified as repaired on Feb 18, 2013 [Ref Western Propeller WO 17502, NCA BN 92467]. \r\nAt the time of it's repair the blade still had 11 months until it's major inspection would have come due Jan 25, 2014. In addition to this the blade had previously been tracking in winair under the part number SFA13UPOA, this part number was corrected and changed to SFA13UP0A when it went out for repair [Ref NCA Repair Order 41544], this may have led to a lack of information for those installing the part or signing it out when it was installed on Mar 29, 2014 [Ref TC 142765-43 LS 48-66047] as the previous component history information would be located under the old part number, not the new part number as per the cert [Ref Western Propeller WO 17502]. It did not become apparent that this component was over due by calender until I, Tech. Records, went to install it in winair.

See attached FAM information below:\r\n\r\n\r\n8.6	Dry Ice	\r\n\r\nDry ice temperature is extremely cold at -109.3Â°F or -78.5Â°C. Always handle dry ice with care and wear protective clothes whenever touching it. If touched briefly, it is harmless, but prolonged contact with the skin will freeze cells and cause injury similar to a burn.\r\n\r\nCatering may load pucks of dry ice in breathable plastic bags into the catering carts and/or carriers whenever required. Flight Attendants should avoid moving the dry ice whenever feasible; leave in place; the dry ice will eventually sublime from a solid to a gas.\r\n\r\nIf there is a need to move the dry ice pucks, place them in a well-ventilated area and allow to sublime. Placing dry ice into airtight containers may cause the container to expand or possibly exploded as the dry ice sublimes to carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide gas will sink to low areas and replace oxygenated air which would cause suffocation if breathed exclusively.\r\n\r\nNormal air is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and only 0.035% carbon dioxide. If the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air rises above 0.5%, carbon dioxide can become dangerous. Smaller concentrations can cause quicker breathing but is otherwise not harmful.\r\n\r\nIf dry ice has been in closed space for more than ten (10) minutes, open doors and allow adequate ventilation before entering.\r\n\r\nLeave area containing dry ice if you start to pant and breathe quickly, or your fingernails or lips start to turn blue.  This is the sign that you have breathed in too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen.\r\n\r\nTreat dry ice burns the same as a regular heat burn.\r\nSee previous SMS Report 2091.\r\n\r\nApril 23. 2014 \r\nJames Wakulchyk Q/A Manager Flt ops; I have reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found;\r\na.

2459,14-04-11 10:00,737 All Types,Ramp/Parking/Maneuvering,Third Party Actions ,Occurrence,YEG Ramp,Medium Risk,"When I walked up to the hangar windows, Flair was just powering out, there was a Citation parked on EFC's ramp, right in the corner at the end of Sierra, the break away thrust was throwing dust, rocks and debris from the ramp surface directly at the Citation. Further complicating the matter was Canadian North's 737-300 was taxiing in down the taxi lane as the Flair aircraft was trying to leave, this left no room for the Flair aircraft to maneuver. The Flair aircraft had to stop with the blast pointed at the airside vehicles by the corner of the building until the Canadian North aircraft taxied out of the way (Canadian North had to position themselves on EFC/Cathton's ramp). At that point the Flair aircraft had to use break away thrust again to get moving which blasted our airside vehicles and the EFC hangar2.\r\n","Insufficient ramp space and poor planning/communication with regards to getting EFC to move their aircraft prior to us starting up and letting the Canadian North Aircraft know what to do. For example the Flair aircraft didn't have to start until the Canadian North aircraft was parked on the second lead in line. There is routinely a helicopter parked on the corner at the end of Sierra, this should be moved prior to every 737 movement on our ramp. I believe we are complacent in our communications to EFC with regards to ensuring clear blast zones as this Helicopter never seems to move. When they park anything there, it blocks access to their ramp so they must use the corner of our ramp to access their ramp, basically nothing should be parked there EVER.","April 14 2014-1015 yxj\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nHandling risk low 2-2\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nAssigned to ramp manager\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Apr 14 2014 13:55 handling risk med 3-3.

When it came time to use the GPU on a dash 8 that was ready to set up for departure, Dave went to plug in the connection and noticed some one had cut off the connector that fits into the aircraft 28v receptacle.

The MCN for replacement of cabin O2 Masks were coming due.  Maintenance planning ordered the pre SB35-3233 masks (PN 174080-106).  They arrived and were placed into the preload bin for installation.  MOC then discovered that pre SB masks had been ordered and ordered the post SB masks after reading the SB and discovering that there could be a safety issue if the pre SB masks were installed.  At this point it was not yet discovered that the HBC SB (which we are not required to comply with) resulted in AD 99-12-07 being issued by the FAA.  The post SB (PN 174080-113) masks arrived and were placed into the preload bin with the -106 masks.  The bin was full and the masks were falling out so the -113 masks were placed into inventory and the -106 masks were left in the bin.  When the engineer was given the work card he went to stores to get the masks and was given the pre SB 174080-106 masks that were in the bin.\r\nThe engineer went to the aircraft and began the task of replacing the O2 masks.  The engineer removed the installed post SB 174080-113 masks and replaced them with the pre SB 174080-106 masks.  While replacing the masks the engineer noticed that the lanyards on the masks he was installing were longer that the ones he was removing and transferred the shorter 174080-113 lanyards to the 174080-106 masks (this effectively complied with SB 35-3233 by replacing the lanyards on the sidewall locations).  The job was completed and the aircraft returned to service.  \r\nThe incorrect installation of the Pre SB O2 masks was again discovered by MOC and a second card was generated to replace the incorrect PN masks with the same part number (post SB) masks as were originally removed.  This was accomplished and the aircraft was again returned to service.\r\nThe retrofit kit mentioned in the HBC SB and the FAA AD are for the replacement of the lanyards and placarding of the O2 mask boxes.  This was essential accomplished during the maintenance actions when the shorter lanyards were installed on the -106 masks with the remarking of the boxes already accomplished at the previous compliance with AD.  AS per the SB the currently installed masks (-106) /box assemblies PN129-384005-3 may be reworked and remarked as mask(-113)/Box assy 129-384005-5.\r\n\r\nThe MCN template has been amended to reflect the requirement for the post SB mask installations compliant with the AD as well as the IPC now contains pop up notes alerting people who are looking at the O2 masks about the requirements of the SB and the AD.\r\n\r\nI would suggest there was not a CAR's infraction and the risk rating should be reduced.\r\n\r\nMay 15 2014-1351L CYXJ\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nAfter the investigation by Bill Stupak I am lowering the risk rating to MED 3-3.

While he was getting down off the manlift he stepped wrong, causing poor foot placement that resulted in rolling his ankle.  He came back into the hanger to try and close the door but had Theo finish closing the door while he sat down on the hanger floor to recoperate.\r\n\r\nFrom what I had observed from the back of the hanger as I was retrieving some oil to add to AQN (the aircraft I was carring out a DI on the ramp), I heard some swearing of the type used when you bang your head or stubb your toe; I had seen the hanger door moving prior and then saw Matt sit down on the hanger floor favoring his left foot, intially I had thought he had pinched his foot in the hanger door, asked if he was ok and he told me he had rolled his ankle jumping off the manlift. He looked uncomfortable, I told him to lay back and relax till he felt a better. As he was laying there I saw his left foot move then his eyes started to roll up into sockets, I call his name, he was unresponsive, the color started to drain from his face, he appered to be going into shock, At that time I told Theo to call 911 as Matt was going into shock.  About  5-10 seconds later Matt became responsive but disoriented, about another 10 seconds on, he was coherent.  During this time he had started to sweat on his forhead. At this time I told him to stay still, relax till the paramedics get here.  In the mean time Herb had come out to the hanger floor with the 911 operator on the phone which he transfered to me and he went to let the paramidics in to the hanger.

Through 1000' I went through the after takeoffs as well as the checklist. Once in the hold and the FMS was programmed we contacted CET2 to let them know we would be starting the approach via muvud. We were informed that 5 other aircraft were in bound, we decided to go in first due to the timing of the first aircraft inbound. Once on the approach inbound prior to the FAF gear was called and then Flaps. I reached for the flaps and brought the lever down. The flaps didn't hit any indents on the way down. This led me to believe I had not retracted the flaps to 0 degrees. When I reaches for them initially prior to bringing them down I felt they were at the 0degree position. I continued with the landing checks and we landed. Because of this I could not be sure the flaps were at 0 or not while flying from the hold to muvud and decided to call maint and inform them of the possibility of a flap overspeed. Prior to calling maint I spoke with my co pilot, he felt the flaps were up and there was no problem. He felt the plane flew as if the flaps were fully retracted as well.  He also mentioned he looked down at the flap indicator when I spoke up about the flaps on approach and he didn't see them past 5 degrees but were traveling.

We identified the malfunction and decided to continue the approach without commencing a go around and without shutting down the affected engine, as landing was in less then a minute.  We observed no smoke or fire, and no unusual engine indications.  There is no fire bottle on CGM so that was not an option that was available to us. After completing a safe landing, we exited on Taxiway Bravo as it was readily available.  We quickly stopped and shut down the engine and inspected the affected engine with the hand held fire extinguisher in hand.  There was no indication of smoke or fire upon inspection. Immediately after we advised OCC and spoke with the MTC control person.  We came to the conclusion after consultation with YYC Maintenance that it may been an erroneous indication due to the photo sensors in the cowling or a bad fire loop.   At this stage it was decided to park the aircraft for the evening and wait for OCC and MTC to devise a plan.

As crew was just approaching FAF, decision was made to continue to land without shutting down. There were no other secondary indications of a fire. Conditions were VMC. Although the AFM requires the engine to be shut down upon illumination of the engine fire light, given the proximity to the runway, the flight crew made a judgement call to leave the engine running. Approximate time from illumination of fire light to engine shut down was 2 minutes or less. \r\n\r\nDiscussed with captain other alternatives - partial shut down and continuing, full shut down and continuing, go around then full shut down. \r\n\r\nFlight landed at approximately 2030 local - sun would have been lower on horizon, possibly causing false indication.

The DHC-8-400 aircraft were delivered to North Cariboo with valid CofA.  As part of the process of issuing the documents it is the responsibility of the importing party to ensure that all aircraft modifications meet Transport Canada requirements.  In the case of these aircraft, being imported from a country which Canada has a technical agreement with, Minor work approved by the previous airworthiness authority can be directly accepted.  The following is a statement from the importer;\r\n\r\nâ€œMy records show the only two STC's for 4028 & 4029 as being the Latitude install and related structural provisions per STC's SA11-84 & SA11-85.  The paperwork for those would have been in the FMS work package for each aircraft as they were installed by Aerocorp. \r\n  \r\nAs I said earlier, the RUAG mods were done as Augsburg EO's. â€œ\r\n\r\nThere was a failure to identify that the door installation were accomplished while foreign registered using the FAA STC approved documents.  Modifications to the door installing the door warning light system (Canadian operational requirement) were also done by the importing company using the door manufactures FAA  approved documentation instead of the Canadian LSTC (aircraft serial number specific) documentation.  Since the DHC-8-400 aircraft is classified as a Large aircraft with a Canadian Type Certificate, all Major Modifications / STCs approved by a foreign airworthiness authority must be familiarized / approved by Transport Canada.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond reasonable expectations to research an aircraft to the level required for importation upon acceptance into our operation.  Once a MD-M issues the CofA for an aircraft, it is accepted that all previous work is valid and approved.  When North Cariboo identified the problem, the entire fleet of Q400 aircraft was grounded until the approvals could be issued and modifications incorporated.\r\n\r\nAttached are copies of the CofA application for import and STC list while the aircraft were foreign registered for both aircraft. \r\n\r\nDue to the failure being instigated by a third party, and no practical safe guards can be implemented by North Cariboo, no corrective action plan or root cause is required.  \r\nAug 14 2014 James Wakulchyk Q/A Manager Flt ops\r\nI have reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found; a.

After speaking with the Captain who created the defect I realized that the DMI was not clear and deferred under the wrong MEL number.  The MEL for the De ice pressure indicator was applied and FWD'd to CDN North for flights on the 22nd when the defect was actually the deice indicator light.  \r\nThe alert card in the log book also stated the de-ice pressure indicator was defective and deferred IAW MEL 30-08. The caution light should have been identified and deferred under MEL 30-09 instead.  The DMI/recurring defect sheet in the back of the log book stated deice pressure was deferred and the MEL number on that sheet was for the indicator as well.  The Placard installed in the aircraft was installed next to the De-Ice pressure indicator.\r\nI made a log entry correcting the error, changed the MEL/CDL form to CDN north and clarified the conditions of the MEL to allow CDN North dispatch to determine if the aircraft could be dispatched for icing. Clarified and updated the alert card and the CDL/recurring defect form to indicate the light and the correct MEL # in the back of the log book and moved the placard next to the Caution light panel.  The expiry date of the DMI did not change.\r\n\r\n","I cannot comment as to what caused the events to occur as I was not there when the original defect was deferred.

The engineer was busy with other defects and completing an L-check in-between flights, he did not have the time to run the aircraft or troubleshoot the pilotâ€™s deferral. The determination of cause then, is a Human error (action error slip) by pilot when deferring the defect (missed the precise wording of indicator vs. caution light, technically a caution light is an indicator). The error trickled through system (was entered on all the required forms and sent to required people etc.) due to the engineer being busy and not confirming the defect.

2535,14-05-26 15:00,None,System or Process Failure,Training,Proactive Safety Observation,CYYC,Medium Risk,"Internal review of NCA pilot training records determined that many flight crew training forms have been administratively changed over the past several years, without proper document control.  Namely, amendment dates and document revision status have not been tracked, and a proper LEP has not been maintained.  These administrative changes are primarily reflected in document titles (added aircraft), footer information, or statements reflecting the revision status of NCA manuals (COM, TPM).  The overall content of these forms remains intact, however, the identity of flight crew training forms as a controlled document appears to have been lost.  These documents from part of the NCA Company Forms Manual, as referenced in the Preamble of the COM.  Training and qualifications records is a CASS requirement of the COM and must therefore be approved.   Suspect that some forms may not have been submitted to TC for approval, however, as some of these forms are last dated 4 to 6 years ago, I cannot be certain.  Additionally, training pilots and ACPs have saved many of these forms to their personal computers from the RP, occasionally using older versions, exasperating the issue.  Forms used have not always been the most up-to-date from the RP.  Although administrative issues have occurred, CARs required training is and has been documented and conducted.","It would appear through last amendment dates that these forms may have lost their identity as a controlled document when COM 1 (702/703/704) and COM 2 (705) were combined to create a single COM.  In this process the flight crew training programs and company forms were separated from the COM, forming COM extensions.  Although the training programs were migrated into their own manuals for which control has been maintained, the company forms were moved solely to the resource planner in a non-manual format.  Therefore, no LEP or amendment record was created.  Admin staff, who have controlled the RP folder for which these forms reside, have changed form titles, etc. when deemed necessary.  It was not clearly understood that these forms require submission for approval when changed, as they did not appear to be in a controlled document.  Current forms do not include a statement indicating they must be attained only from the company resource planner/forms library, as this system was not in place the last time many of these forms were created.","James Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops May 27 2014 - handling risk medium 2-4.

Because of the lapse in time since the incident occurred, the PIC was unable to say how the error occurred. He was certain the individual did not travel on board, but was unable to explain why the manifest with OCC was not updated.

Also, only one discrepancy was found through all the OFP's audited. \r\n\r\nThis is an Action Error - Lapse. \r\n\r\nIn review, the impact to safety management and the likelihood of reoccurrence is determined to be low.  This investigation has been reviewed and determined to be managed to As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP), and meets the SMS requirements for a root cause analysis.  The cause has been determined to be a human error and unintentional deviation from a single standard, procedure or process.  The individual was provided all appropriate training on these procedures, but failed to carry out the requirement of this single task.

2548,14-06-03 18:10,DHC-8,Operations procedures,Cabin Safety Procedures,Occurrence,Threshold 08,Low Risk,"There was an occurrence just before the Q400 departed Kirby yesterday evening at 18:10 direct back to Calgary on the Devon corporate flight #1306. Instead of responding last night out our anger and bewilderment, I let it percolate overnight. I believe this is a reportable occurrence. \r\n\r\nâ€¢	Crew arrived back to aerodrome from Pike approx. 1700 (1 hour before flight)\r\nâ€¢	All parties were informed that there was flow into YYC, and a departure for 1810 was allocated to Flt   #1306\r\nâ€¢	Aircraft boarded approx. 17:55\r\n\r\nAt approx. 18:05 the question by my staff was raised whether the keys for the Flex had been returned after use by the crew for the day spent at Pike Camp. FGNJ was taxiing at the end of RWY 08 positioning for a 26 departure, engines running. Our radio operator asked the crew via Unicom if they had returned the keys for the Flex and after a few moments, the reply from the cockpit was that the keys were in their pocket. Our radio operator suggested the Aerodrome staff drive down to the threshold and retrieve them, or if the crew wanted to taxi back to the terminal to drop them off. The answer our radio operator got back was that the crew of FGNJ would just throw the keys out the aft door. There was a pause, as this response obviously seemed like a joke. Before we could advise against this plan, it was already in motion, and another aerodrome employee confirmed this through binoculars, and watched the aft door open on the end of 08 while running, and saw the keys being thrown out the door. I donâ€™t know whether a flight attendant or pilot opened that aft door, but I would assume the pilots would not leave the flight deck.\r\nOur entire staff spent time after shift looking for the keys. They were found on the turnaround bay 08.\r\n\r\nConcerns:\r\n\r\nâ€¢	FOD on the RWY\r\nâ€¢	Keys could have been tossed by prop-wash into the infield and lost (only set we have)\r\nâ€¢	Perception of this act by clients\r\nâ€¢	Damage to field MTC equipment had the key ended up in the infield and mowed\r\nâ€¢	Keys could have simply be brought back this morning for the todayâ€™s corporate flight, unnecessary action\r\nâ€¢	Unprofessional and irresponsible, disrespectful of property\r\n",Unnecessary act,"June 4 2014-0842 L CYXJ\r\nVern Lace-Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nFlight ops Q/A to determine risk\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nAssigned to managers\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops June 4 2014 12:13 report under review by vetting team for handling risk.  Moved from directors and assigned to managers\r\n\r\nTodd Chahley - Director, Cabin Safety & Customer Service/05JUN14\r\n\r\nIn-Charge Flight Attendant Report:\r\nI answered the call cause I was in the jump seat, Jermey was on the phone and was rushing saying they forgot the keys and that we needed to get them back I asked if we were going back and that's when throwing them out the back door came up, he said the ramp guys would come get them once we were gone. He said they were going to feather down the left prop then we could open the door a bit and toss them out. Like I said I never really thought much of it because I thought that the pilots and Kirby crew had come to this decision. He opened up the door and gave me the keys, I proceed to the back of the aircraft where I explained to Sydney what was happening. They feathered down the prop, she cracked the door and I threw out the keys. I came back up to the front and explained to Emilie that the pilots forgot the keys and had called us and told us to crack the back door and throw them out. No passengers asked me any questions. I took my seat and called up front and told them the door was now closed and the cabin was secure he said awesome and hung up the phone. I was not at all made aware that they did not receive a response from the Kirby crew, to my understanding everyone had agreed to this decision. \r\n\r\n2LR Flight Attendant Report:\r\nFrom my point of view of the situation yesterday (as the 2LR FA) this is what I witnessed unfold:\r\nWe had taxied out to the end of the runway and the pilots call to the back where the in-charge (Riley) picked up the phone, after a short discussion with them she opened the flight deck door and grabbed the keys to the crew vehicle that we had used to get to and from the pike camp.\r\nShe quickly came to the back of the plane and told me that we were to wait for the props to feather and then open the back door a bit and toss the keys out the door so that the ground crew could retrieve them. \r\nI opened the door a bit and Riley threw the keys out. We later herd from the pilots that the crew in Kirby had gotten the keys and that was that. \r\nI assumed that we did not taxi back to the terminal because we had flow time into Calgary. I did not question the pilots decisions. \r\n\r\nI now know that this is something I have the right to question and even refuse to do, as this can be dangerous, especially with PAX on board. \r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk June 6 2014 - per discussion in vetting team SMS report set at low risk.

2549,14-06-04 13:25,None,Miscellaneous,,Occurrence,On the ramp just outside Gate 1,Low Risk,"I received a Sysco order today. One of the skids was loaded too high and with boxes at the bottom that were sinking in under the weight of product stacked above. Therefore much of the product was leaning to the side quite a bit. So I took another skid and offloaded half of the product onto the new skid. Before transporting this new skid with the fork lift I did not think about shrink-wrapping it. Upon exiting hanger 6 I drove around the corner at a speed that usually works well, but this time some of the product fell off due to centrifugal force. Some of the product is deformed but otherwise in good and clean condition. Only about 5 drink containers are punctured and therefore waste. I picked up the goods and continued under much greater care.",I was used to prepacked skids that are shrink wrapped and remain stable when taking corners at a moderate rate. I did not consider how much centrifugal force can act on the loose product.\r\nI did not pack the product in an interlocking manner that would be more stable.\r\nI did not consult ramp if we have shrink wrap.\r\nI could have been more careful in taking the corner.\r\n,"James Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops June 5 2014 9:50 reviewed per OSH 14.34 position and loads.

2556,14-06-04 13:20,B 1900D,Ground Proximity Warning,,Occurrence,RNAV Z Rwy 24 Approach to CYDQ,Low Risk,"In the morning, on the way up to CYYE, we did an approach into CYDQ with a broken ceiling of 600'.  We elected to do a SCDA approach with the RNAV Z Rwy 24.  We just barely saw the runway before doing a missed approach, but did see it and landed.  We thought that if we had been at MDA for a bit longer we would have seen it sooner, since the ceiling was ragged and the forward visibility was excellent below the cloud.  We thought that in the afternoon, when we return to CYDQ, we would do a step-down approach so that we'd be at MDA longer to have a better chance to see it sooner.\r\n\r\nSo in the afternoon, when we had to return to CYDQ, the ceiling was the same broken 600', so we did the step-down approach as discussed earlier.  The altitude from SAVAM (IF) to MAROX is 4000'.  Then after MAROX, it goes down to 3200' to ADSEG.  Once we crossed MAROX, we (Mark Friesen was the PF, and I was the PM) began the descent to 3200'.  Upon descending, we received a terrain warning, and since we were in IMC, we elected to conduct a go-around.  We then received a new clearance to conduct another approach, and made it a SCDA approach, and avoided the terrain warning and landed successfully.","Upon thinking about it, there is a pretty big hill that is located underneath the approach.  I believe that what happened was that our rate of descent (which I don't believe exceeded 1000fpm), coupled with the rising hill terrain underneath us caused the GPWS to believe that we were descending beyond it's warning limits, and generated an audible warning at that time.","June 6 2014-0827-CYXJ-L\r\nVern Lace-Q/A Manager Maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nHandling risk to be determined by Q/A Flight ops.\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops June 6 2014 - handling risk low per initial report.

I (sean taylor) briefed a left base onto runway 34. I had briefed to decent below the clouds early as to be able to cancel the IFR early so as to be able to avoid a high decent rate closer to the ground and to ensure we would be able to complete the approach visually. At this point we were direct wtman way point. As we broke the clouds i saw what had all the visual signs of Kelowna similar runway alignment similar ridge between lake and airport and similar high hill on the southern side. What really made Vernon airport look like Kelowna was a forest fire about 5 nm straight up from the airport to the south. This same location had a fire burning on it in ex actually the same geographical location in Kelowna that Both Josh and i had had a good conversation on apx 6 hours earlier on our way out of Kellowna to Albian. All the visual ques added up to me however i was a bit high so i expedited the decent as we were just about to enter direct onto the down wind left(as briefed) as i turned base we were on a proper profile. as i turned final (apx 8 miles) i instantly realized this wasn't the kellowna airport and as i came to this in my mind josh said at that same time this isn't kellowna. Instantly the decision was made to execute a 180 degree turn before entering the valley. The decision was to turn left so as to be able to see out the window during the turn and it offered the greatest opened area. I began to turn and leveled off added power to apx 90% and began to climb. I decided to be aggressive in the turn 30 degrees as to ensure terrain and to avoid getting into the traffic pattern the the wrong airport as we were not aware of its frequencies. we turned apq 180 degrees and leveled off. As we were just about to roll level i herd Josh say your torques are a bit high and he reached and pulled them back. as he did looked at them and they were at 105% he pulled them back. we but direct to kellowna airport into the FMS at that point as to regain our situational awareness. we then flew to kellowna with no other incident. \r\nOn the ground we discussed the incident and what went wrong. We discussed the torques and what we saw them get up to, we were both very convinced from what we saw they never went over 105% well under the 20 minute 115 limits.

He told me that the filter might not actually be due annually or that maybe it had actually been changed. I told him that the placard says otherwise and that we weren't going flying until he could tell us what was going on. \r\n\r\nI realize the odds of contaminated fuel were extremely low. The truck had it's own clear and bright test performed, plus aircraft had been using fuel out of that truck for the last week without incident, however, I found the fueller's attitude unprofessional in the sense that he should have immediately quarenteened his truck and sought a resolution WITHOUT me having to force the issue.

It definitely looks like the Jet porter caused the damage, however it went completely unnoticed that they caused any damage while maneuvering the aircraft. Iâ€™ve asked around and no one has come forward about it, it may be worth checking the cameras to see if anyone looks like they may know more about it then they â€˜re willing to admit. It was careless to connect the strap around the nose gear that way, and I have made the proper instructions regarding hook ups with the jet porter very clear to everyone since this incident. I will continue to search for more information about this report. For the most part I think they need to slow down and take the time to make sure all tow equipment is connected properly. Iâ€™ve put this on the leads to ensure the crews are following our ramp sopâ€™s, the leads can come to me with any issues they are having with the other attendants.  \r\nRyan Kuemper\r\nSupervisor, Ramp Operations\r\n\r\nTrevor Smith Senior Supervisor of Airports, June 19, 2014\r\nAttached CAP and new practical training sign off for the Jetporter.

I immediately went to the front of the cabin with a bottle of water and saw that his lips had turned blue so i proceeded to try to get his attention.

I then called the flight deck to notify the pilots of the situation. Debs answered and i told her there was a passenger whos lips had turned blue and he was passing out. she told me she would tell glen and would call me right back and to keep her informed of any changes. I continued to try to keep the passenger awake and responsive. I asked him more questions and found out he was short of breath and that he was getting over a cold. he also told me he was working the night shift and hadnt slept in almost two days.

2577,14-06-17 13:00,BE 200,Engine- Hot Start,Cockpit Indication - On ground,Occurrence,CYYC Ramp,Low Risk,"On the initial #2 (right) engine start of GDFN after the engine starter had starting turning the engine, ITT was noticed to be reading around 800Â° C. No fuel had been added yet so I selected Ignition & Engine Start â€˜Offâ€™ and Battery Master â€˜Offâ€™. I figured it could be just an engine gauge issue and they usually go away with a power off and reset. When I turned the Battery Master back â€˜Onâ€™, the ITT showed a steady 750Â° C with no engine cranking. I snagged the airplane and maintenance discovered that one of the cockpit lighting 'post light' wires had come loose and was touching the right ITT gauge. Cockpit lighting was MELâ€™d and the gauge was shown to be working again. The aircraft was released for flight and we started the engine start process again with the #2 engine. Battery volts at the time were 24 V. The engine start process proceeded normally and the ITT gauge was working indicating a normal engine start, but after â€˜secondary light offâ€™ ITT spiked rapidly. By the time I was able to select â€˜Fuel Cutoffâ€™, ITT had climbed to 1100Â° C for 1 second. I used the remaining engine starter time limit for an engine clearing procedure as per SOP's.

He was working on the wing to fusealage bolt inspection, and was in the middle of torquing one of the aft wing bolts when the accident occured. Nobody was witness to the accident so we can not say what happened. Mark Oostlander was working on the left side of LWN when he heard noise of tools hitting the ground when he looked over and saw Stacey on the ground moving around. He immediately went over to see what happened and noticed Stacey rocking on the ground holding his left side and was in pain. Mark cleaned the tools from around Stacey and got him a cushion to lay on. I was walking into hangar 5 when the other contractors told me that someone was hurt over by LWN. I proceeded over to see what happened, found Stacey lying on the floor in pain and holding his left side. I immediately told Shawn Tuff to call for an ambulance, in which he got Brett Farnsworth to call and give the operator the information. While waiting for the ambulance Stacey was conscious and talking the whole. When the paramedics arrived they examined Stacey and had him stand up. He was able to walk out to the ambulance under his own power. At the time of this report Stacey was still in the hospital awaiting diagnosis. We have printed up a WCB form and filled out what we could, and have to wait for Stacey to fill out the rest.  ","Not sure what happened, as there were no witnesses to the accident.

Working together, the carts were void of their contents onboard the aircraft, and the empty half size Atlas carts were then offloaded via the Service Door located on aircraft right, aft. This process was completed for all aircraft, with aircraft AQN being the final aircraft to be done.\r\n\r\nDuring the removal process, an unattached piece or serving plate of the galley cart became loose and fell on the employee's toe resulting in the injury. This was a non-standard galley cart, and it was not known that there existed this additional piece to the cart, nor that it would become dislodged from the cart during movement. This was an unfortunate and unforeseen accident.\r\n\r\nThe resulting impact to safety management and the likelihood of reoccurrence is determined to be low. This investigation has determined the risks to be managed to As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP), and meets the SMS requirements for a root cause analysis. The cause has been determined to be a human error, which resulted from a lack of a process for galley equipment removal.  My investigation has determined this decision was not affected by an external or environmental influence, which could have contributed to the decision made by the individual. This situation as reported has not occurred within the framework of recent guidance and the originator has self-reported this occurrence to record the event and to allow the organization to review for any possible improvements. The report has been reviewed with the originator and they have been made aware of the significance or impacts of this event.\r\n\r\nImmediate corrective action, communicated to the members of Cabin Safety Management, includes a cursory review of all galley equipment being loaded or offloaded from an aircraft to ensure the piece of equipment is secured and all latches are closed properly and any and all removable trays, dry ice drawers, or non-secured pieces are either removed prior to loading or offloading, or are secured in such a manner as to avoid injury prior to loading or offloading.

2597,14-06-24 16:00,None,Facilities,,Occurrence,CYEG Hangar,Medium Risk,"We needed to use air to clean NSN's nacelle with the foamer, but when we went to use it there was no air pressure. The compressor was on earlier, but had turned itself off and had smoke pouring out of it. The air compressor room was full of smoke, so much that we couldn't breath without covering our faces. The smoke was coming from the front panel of the air compressor. \r\n\r\nThis is an ongoing issue in YEG. The compressor room is where we keep our fridge for lunches etc. and is next to maintenance office. The vapors leak into Maintenance office creating a haze where we do our paperwork. I believe that this air is not safe to breath, but no one has said if the vapors are safe or not. Dennis P. claims these are just oil vapors??? Are they safe oil vapors though? or are we breathing in harmful vapors? \r\n\r\nThis has been happening for months now and it has become a Norm to just ignore it, keep the air compressor off at all times, or just use dry nitrogen instead. MTC Memo MSB-20-14-003 says Use of unserviceable equipment around aircraft is NOT acceptable. If something is broken,\r\ndon't just accept it or find a work-around, tag it out of service per the ramp manual\r\nrequirements and get it fixed.\r\n\r\nIf these Vapors/smoke are safe then can we get them tested? probably cost the same as a new compressor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","This problem with the air compressor keeps getting deferred and put off bu saying  we are waiting on parts  but even when it does get worked on nothing changes.\r\nPeople have been ignoring the problem and just keeping it off until they need it or using nitrogen instead (which is costly for the company).\r\nWe need an air compressor in the hangar, and the one we have isn't going to work much longer.\r\nThe cost of the air compressor seems to get in the way of either fixing it properly or replacing it.\r\n\r\nI have put the risk rating at 3-5 High risk because it happens every time the air compressor is used, and nobody knows whether it is safe to breath the vapors( I believe it is not, and will continue to believe this until the air is tested and confirmed safe to breath)","June 25 2014-0930L CYXJ\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nHandling risk MED-3-3 due reported contaminated air.\r\nAssigned to manager\r\n\r\nKen Pratt July 17, 2014- We have not been ignoring the problem as the submitter suggests, the air compressor in YEG is a very high quality and expensive complicated unit, the parts for it have to come from Europe. We troubleshot it per the maintenance manual, ordered a repair kit for the valve that stops the pressure from back feeding through the compressor, this didnâ€™t fix the problem, we ordered a repair kit for the unloading valve, didnâ€™t fix it. Denis called in a technician who recommended we change the oil stop valve, we waited for the valve for a month and it did not fix the problem, we discovered that the unloading valve was assembled incorrectly from previously, but this didnâ€™t solve the problem either. We finally found a shuttle valve that had come apart inside and was allowing the pressure downstream of the first valve we rebuilt to bleed back to the oil tank which was pushing air through the scavenge line when the compressor was off, this air was vaporizing through the scavenge line orifice in the bottom of the screw compressor and sending â€œsmokeâ€ out the compressor inlet air filter. The shuttle valve has been ordered, the compressor is disassembled and is out of service until repairs are completed. We did not just replace the compressor at first signs of trouble because this would cost in the neighborhood of $20-30000 for a comparable unit. The smoke was water vapor but it had been exposed to oil, but since it was forced through a filter it seems like the filter mostly caught the oil, nothing in the room was covered in oily mist.

So as pax loaded the plane I noticed some intoxicated ones.  As I did zone count I asked 4 pax that were all sitting together how much they had to drink, they refused to answer me, I told them there was 0 tolerance policy to drinking.  They all smelled like they were drinking had glossy eyes and refused to acknowledge the policy.  Because I said there was a 0 tolerance policy I decided to deny them.

While we were discussing what to do in the back galley, the pax in row 20C pulled out a green Auto seal water bottle with a cover around the bottom, he took a sip and returned it to the seat-back pocket in front of him. Rocio and I discussed it and came to the consensus that we should confront  the pax and ask him politely if we could smell the contents of his water bottle, as the liquid inside appeared to be a dark red. Upon approaching the pax in 20C it became apparent to me that he had been drinking, the aroma of alcohol was strong and his face was very flush. I asked him if I could smell the contents of the water bottle, and at first he was hesitant, but gave in. He handed me the bottle. Immediately after I got procession of the water bottle, the pax became worried and asked what now?, even before I smelt the contents inside. I smelt the water bottle, and immediately recognized the smell of Red Wine. I asked the passenger what was inside the water bottle, and at first he would not confess. Finally he owned up, and informed me that it was red wine. Immediately I seized the water bottle and passed it to Rocio, who notified the captain. The bottle with Alcohol was secured in a safe place during the duration of the flight. \r\nI informed the passenger to please move to the empty row 21FD as the smell was becoming extremely potent on board and didn't want to interrupt the Pax seated beside him. Upon ensuring the pax was seated and secured in, I informed him that we would be seizing the water bottle, and asked him for his Goverment issued I.D and his site badge. I proceeded to tell him, that bringing alcohol on board an aircraft that has no approval is against the law and would not be tolerated, and that as crew we would be taking all necessary steps in procedures and regulations regarding this issue. I let him know that he may experience the effects of the alcohol more as we climbed to altitude, and showed him where the sick bags were, and reiterated where the bathroom was. ( although I did inform him that he should remain seated through the duration of the flight, unless there was absolute need to get up. The pax remained in his seat quiet during the remainder of the flight. During the inter-phone conversation between the in-charge and the PIC, it was discussed if we wanted to return to YLW or carry on to AL4, due to the pax in questions, calm and obedient attitude, the crew decided not to take the delay and have AL4 security meet us on the plane. \r\nOn our arrival into AL4 pax were asked to remain seated even after the seatbelt sign was turned off, and we awaited for AL4 security. The PAX was identified to the ground staff, and escorted off accordingly. \r\n\r\nI do want to mention the great crew communication that was demonstrated throughout the situation, by both the pilots, flight attendants, and ground staff. I hope this sets an example for future pax travelling on any air carrier. \r\n\r\nAny questions about the above report can be directed to the undersigned. \r\n\r\nBest Regards \r\n\r\nJaden Dueck \r\nFlight Attendant \r\nNorth Cariboo Air\r\n600 Palmar Road NE \r\nCalgary Alberta \r\n","I believe the cause was solely on the Pax that was found guilty.

Response as follows:\r\n\r\nDue to the late and unexpected passenger arriving at the aerodrome, all aircraft had to hold because we didnâ€™t know which flight he was supposed to be on, and allowing him onto the ramp while other aircraft engines are running, would have created a potentially unsafe situation. We donâ€™t allow passengers on our apron while there is live aircraft movement for passenger safety. The delay was not limited to this flight only, but all aircraft departing that particular day. Had we allowed any flights to leave, we would have further delayed others.\r\n \r\nThis SMS report is a one off, and I donâ€™t believe there are measurable parameters to successfully track and maintain a corrective action plan due to many existing variables that change aircraft sequencing and departures at Kirby lake. I would recommend adding the air conditioners if required, as they can be utilized to maintain a more comfortable temperatures inside aircraft cabins, but ultimately, this occurrence is more due to 3rd party influence (Devon passenger arriving late) than anything related to the aerodrome and safe practice.\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk Jan 15 2015-Q/A Mgr Flt Ops; I have reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found; a.

Note: there are no approaches for 24 to get any avionics help.  Due to the environmental conditions, we did not see rwy 24 to line up with it in time, and mistook rwy 19 for 24.  We conduced the missed approach when we realized that we were lined up for rwy 19, and it would have been unstable to try to maneuver over for rwy 24.

July 29 2014\r\n\r\nDarren Cassel Fleet Specialist 703/704 Aug 6, 14.  \r\nInvestigation of maintenance completed on left engine ice vane system to the beginning of January 2014.  This system has been worked on extensively, 9 task cards for work completed, by four different AME's.  As of July 24, 2014 the system was repaired on TC 142712-131, and is currently serviceable.  \r\n\r\nDarren Cassel Fleet Specialist 703/704 Aug 27, 14.\r\nThis was a unapproved maintenance procedure to cheat the adjustment of the engine intake ice vane position micro-switches.  The King Air Ice Vane system is a complicated system with a lot of moving parts that live in a high stress environment.  Air loads in flight are significant, and cause a lot of wear and tear on the ice vane system.  The cause of this issue was wear on the ice vane hinge arm bushings, that reduced the overall travel of the ice vane doors, and did not fully actuate the micro-switch.   The ice vane system on this aircraft had been snagged 9 times over the last year.  The proper procedure would be to rectify the worn parts and re-rig micro-switches for proper actuation points.  The ice vane position switches have a lot of adjustment to them, allowing them to be adjusted while there is some wear in the system. But if the ice vane system is worn excessively, there will not be enough travel to make the switch, even when the switch is at its maximum adjustment. \r\n\r\nConducted interview's with AME's involved, very little to add to investigation from interviews.  The piece of material used modify ice vane position micro-switch was not seen or noticed by anyone involved.  The results of the investigation are inconclusive.  Unable to find the exact time when the material was added to the aircraft, or the person responsible.  \r\n\r\nShort Term Corrective Action, interviews conducted AME's involved, and pre shift meeting with both crews to explain and remind everyone to be vigilant.

Russ told them they had permission to move the 1900 but that he knew nothing about the 200. They moved it anyways. Once I determined this had happened I informed our maintenance department and my chief pilot of the situation. I got Northern Air Charters to send an engineer over to take a look to see if anything was damaged. It appeared to him that nothing was and our maintenance department gave me the ok to continue with the rest of the flying I had to do.

The tail was roughly 10 feet from exiting the hangar, when I looked up to notice one of the fall restraints (one hanging fairly dead centre in the hangar) was entangled on the horizontal stabilizer, captain's side. It broke free at that very moment, and the force of the restraint retracting into the ceiling, with the forward movement of the aircraft caused it to forcefully swing around the horizontal stabilizer, resulting in the hook end striking the topside of the stab, just forward of the elevator. The impact caused a small dent, approximately 0.5 inches around, 2-3 CM deep\r\n\r\nI immediately stopped moving the aircraft, and maintenance was called to inspect the aircraft. \r\n\r\nBrad was wing-walking on starboard side, Catherine on the port side. No tail walker was needed, as there was sufficient space available in the hangar.\r\n\r\nThe restraint didn't appear to have been already caught on the tail before aircraft movement, and unfortunately, went unnoticed when it became caught, as the restraint swung around in a very short amount of time, and also, as the aircraft was being pulled out of the hangar there was no immediate concern for the fall restraint to become trapped. (highest likelihood of it becoming trapped is pushing an aircraft into a hanger, where the trim tabs may trap the restraint strings) ","As stated above, there was no immediate concern the restraint string would become entangled on the leading edge of the horizontal stab when being pulled out of the hangar. Aircraft was moved in accordance to normal procedures.\r\n\r\nHowever, the main causes can be attributed to poor visibility of the actual string itself, as it is very thin, and difficult to see against the backdrop of the hangars.\r\n\r\nThe second main cause is being unaware of the fall restraints as a hazard, however this was deemed a non-issue as it was being pulled forward.

I have attached their findings and recommend we do these as soon as the busy fire season is over. \r\n\r\nAfter reading through the audit and being in contact with the auditor here are my recommendations for this fall:\r\n\r\n1.	Replace hose as it is over its life span.(Fuel hose reel is not working and lays on the ground, this does cause the hose to weather more quickly, I recommend we replace the motor so the hose can be reeled up after each use)\r\n2.	Once the fire season is complete and the fuel quantity is low, have the tank cleaned internally.(This is recommended for Slave Lake as well)\r\n3.	Install an emergency shutoff valve.\r\n4.	Install or invest in a portable pump to take fuel samples from the lowest point in the tank.\r\n5.	Replace all faded and unreadable decals.\r\n6.	Have fuel metre calibrated.\r\n7.	45 gallon drum designed for spill response(our current spill response container is not adequate for the amount of fuel that we store in the event of a major leak) \r\n8.	Lastly the asphalt around the Jet A tank is in very poor condition and needs some work done before this upcoming winter.\r\n9.	The auditor often states that no documentation is available for our quality control. We do have daily, weekly and monthly checks being done and they are recorded electronically. He has requested that a binder be available at the tank so pilots taking fuel have the documentation available prior to each fueling.  \r\n\r\nThis will definitely cost a bit but will ensure a safer system and will keep us within aviation fuel legislation. With several items we are in violation and I will be working with Jordan to have these dealt with in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nJeff Braun\r\nSlave Lake Base Manager\r\nCan-West Corporate Air Charters\r\nCell      780-805-2539\r\nWork  780-849-5353\r\nFax      780-849-4552\r\nJeff.Braun@canwestair.com \r\n\r\nTrevor Smith, Senior Supervisor of Airports, Aug 25. 2014\r\nFollow up email from Jeff Braun\r\nGood day,\r\nIn regards to the fuel audit completed by North Cariboo Air, the following items have been completed as of August 22, 2014.\r\n                -New 100ft fuel hose installed, pressure tested with no leaks.\r\n                -New placards and stickers \r\n                -New spill response kit\r\nTo come in the following week, we have an electrician coming to install a proper emergency shutoff. \r\nTo come in the following month, we will have the fuel tank inspected and cleaned.\r\nWe are also in the process of updating our system in the way we record quality control and inspection checks.  \r\n\r\nAny questions you may have please feel free to contact me any time.\r\n\r\nJeff Braun\r\nSlave Lake Base Manager\r\n\r\nTrevor Smith Senior Supervisor of Airports, Oct 5, 2014\r\nAttached Fuel QA document from Wabasca\r\nPlease see attached email from Jeff Braun\r\nGood day,\r\nIn regards to the fuel audit completed by North Cariboo Air, the following items have been completed.\r\n                -New 100ft fuel hose installed, pressure tested with no leaks.\r\n                -New placards and stickers \r\n                -New spill response kit\r\n                -Emergency shutoff has been installed\r\n                -Tank has been completely emptied and cleaned\r\n                -Velcon portable system with clear and bright jar to sample low points in the tank\r\n                -Quality control records will now be kept on site with our emergency plan\r\n\r\nAny questions you may have please feel free to contact me any time.\r\n\r\nJeff Braun\r\n\r\nOctober 6 2014\r\nVern Lace-Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nHandling risk MED\r\n\r\nDave Williamson DOM Oct 6, 2014 \r\n\r\nAll audit findings actioned.

Shorten ACP 705. \r\nCrew was able to accommodate revised approach procedures due to aircraft on runway (although on approach for 35, circled for 17 due to aircraft at threshold of 17). As stated above, it is not required to obtain clearance prior to departing, as this is Class E airspace. However, given the complex nature of the airspace, YEG centre is available via radio contact while on the ground in YNR, in order to provide both IFR and VFR clearances prior to departure. It is the expectation that all aircraft will contact YEG centre prior to departure. \r\n\r\nSpoke with radio room in YNR. They had kept a log of the events on the 12 August. On initial contact with YNR, the RJ crew advised of an ETA of 1400Z into YNR. Empress 1713 (Canadian North 737) contacted YNR at 1348Z to request the advisory. Given the ETA of 1400Z of our RJ, the 737 crew elected to depart 17, believing there was sufficient time to get airborne and out of the arrival path of runway 35 prior to the RJ's arrival. However, the RJ crew contacted YNR at Kedmo (approximately 11.4 mi from threshold) at 1351Z. They were early. As a result, they were required to manouevre visually for 17 since the 737 was on the runway.\r\n\r\nA contributing factor was the helicopter to the south east of the aerodrome, resulting in requiring the RJ to circle to the west of the aerodrome. Circling is restricted to the west, but circuits for 17 must be right hand.\r\n\r\nWaiting to hear back from Canadian North re their procedures.\r\n\r\nAs per conversation with T.

It is their expectation that the flight crew will contact YEG Centre on the backtrack, providing there is no conflicting traffic on the inbound based on the advisory received from the airport operator.  At YNR, it is frequently not possible to reach YEG Centre while on the apron - it is an accepted practice that YEG Centre will be contacted while on the button, due to this. \r\n\r\nAs a result, based on all available information, the crew of the 737 elected to  commence their departure believing they had sufficient time prior to the arrival of the RJ. \r\n\r\nRFC. \r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Nov 5 2014 - statement in investigator comments from Oct 28,  it is not required to obtain clearance prior to departing, as this is Class E airspace. is not correct.  Discussed with investigator to add comments for clarity on Class E airspace.  This clarification does NOT change the outcome of the investigation;\r\n\r\nThe airspace in the northern oilsands area is Class E staring at 3500ft ASL; however, there are boxes around the 4 airports that extend from ground level up to 3500 ft that are class E control zones.  Therefore, the airspace in Horizon is class E from ground level on up.  This requires an ATC clearance for an IFR aircraft to enter this airspace, either to enter or from the ground.  Contacting centre is mandatory when on the ground to obtain a clearance to depart.  The other alternative is to request and be granted a clearance to depart under VFR conditions and then pick it up the IFR in the air.\r\nJames Wakulchyk Nov 5 2014-Q/A Mgr Flt Ops; I have reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found; a.

I advised Edmonton Centre that were planning the RNAV / Visual for RWY 03. We switched to Enroute freq. and made calls on 126.7 and 123.2 for our arrival into CYPY. After my broadcast a POLARIS flight departing CYPY advised that they were back tracking for a departure off RWY22. A short time later they called us and requested our ETA, I advised them of it and they said they were unable to depart due to us being inbound. Once we were visual with the Airport about 20-15nm back I call Edmonton Centre back and advised them that we would cancel our IFR and keep our alerting open thus allowing the POLARIS traffic to depart without having to wait for us to land. I advised the Polaris traffic on 123.2 that we had just canceled our IFR and were direct VISUT visual RWY 03. They said thanks and they would back track for RWY 22. We slowed down and continued in to our final approach fix. I heard POLARIS  call rolling RWY 22 when we were on about a 5 mile base shortly after I saw them rotate and climb out off of RWY 22.

We then proceeded and made sure the pressure switch was in the correct position (which it was),  we also cycled the bleeds again to verify that was not the cause.  Upon talking with maintenance over the radio we proceeded to select the pressurization switch to test to see a cabin drop for there diagnostic purpose which it tested fine.  After no luck we completed all checklists and asked for vectored return for the ILS 35L.  As pre SOPs we tuned and identified all avionics for the ILS 35L upon localizer interception I noticed my glide slope was still flagged and the copilot side was not.

When it landed in YEG, they called maintenance over to T3. It was determined that the aircraft be grounded and towed over to the NCA hangar. Executive Flight Center would tug SUA over to us, and then hand off the responsibility to myself (Sutherland) to pull it the rest of the way inside. Once the airplane was in the hangar, myself, Trevor Smith, and Brennan Pasay noticed that the gear pins, both the nose and mains, had not been installed. This fact had been missed by the flight crew, our AME's, the EFC tow crew, and the NCA tow crew.","I think the the root cause was complacency. All parties involved missed an important step in towing any airplane.

The impact to safety is low and the likelihood of reoccurrence is unlikely (low risk).  This investigation has investigated the occurrence and has determined it to be managed to As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP), although it meets the SMS formal requirements for a root cause analysis, this statement constitutes a root-cause analysis.  It has also been determined this decision was not affected by an external, or environmental influence, which could have contributed to the decisions made by the individual.  The originator has self-reported this deviation to record the event and to allow the organization to review for possible improvement.   The report has been reviewed with the originator and they have been made aware of the significance of this event. As a ramp crew in YEG moving of the Avro RJ with a tug happens infrequently I have determined this to be Human failure, Action Error Lapse.\r\nAttached is a memo reminding ramp to be sure to check gear pins prior to towing aircraft distributed to all ramp staff.\r\nDuring the course of this investigation I have discovered that there is no direction on who's responsibility it is to install gear pins both when at NCA facilities as well as away from base. I have talked to different flight crew that have said that it is the flight crews responsibility to install them at the end of a flight when they walk away from the aircraft, while others state that it is the ramp or maintenance job to do so. When this question was brought up in the maintenance meeting no one was able to state definitively who's responsibility it was either. As I am a supervisor and not able to set policy i would like to re assign the report to Both Dave Williamson as well as Lanny Benoit to discuss and come up with a definitive decision on how NCA should proceed.\r\nInvestigation complete from a ramp perspective will wait for direction from the completion of the investigation.\r\n\r\nDave Williamson DOM Nov. 17, 2014.\r\nFlight Department to issue a memo detailing gear pin installation procedures when 3rd party Contract Companies are used for towing.\r\n\r\nDavid Heiduk -SMS - 17 Nov 2014 1945(L)\r\nDue to handling error (SMS Program Analyst temporary work reassignment) SMS records did not get updated and resulted in a second extension not being granted as requested, therefore a second extension is now granted making this report due for RFC on or before 02nd December 2014.

Wx at the time of arrival was good VMC with light winds.  Crew set up for a straight-in, 10 mile final.  Wind indications during the descent and approach confirmed winds favoring rwy 31.  Runway was in sight 8 miles back, and was assessed clear by the flight crew.  First Officer was PF, with Capt PM.  During the flare into short final, Capt noticed that there was a pedestrian and a dog  in the grass, approximately 150' north of the runway.  Crew elected to continue the landing since both the pedestrian and the dog were not an immediate hazard to the aircraft.  After touchdown, a second pedestrian and 3 more dogs were also noticed north of the runway.  As the a/c commenced the turn to exit the runway northbound onto the apron, it was observed by the F/O that a water bottle and dog dish were on the runway surface, near the runway lights for the turn off.  After shutting down the aircraft and closing the flight plan, the Capt approached the 2 pedestrians, who were by this time walking east with all 4 dogs off-leash on the paved runway, away from the apron.  The pedestrians were informed that they were in an area which was not to be occupied by people or pets, but the pedestrians insisted that they had a right to be in the area due to a lack of signage at the airport forbidding access, and due to an internet search which also yielded no information to the contrary.  The Capt informed them that this was, in fact, a safety issue, and could put the lives of both the pedestrians and their pets in danger, along with the aircraft, crew and passengers.  The pedestrians responded that they were willing to accept that risk.  The Capt informed them that it wasn't their right to accept that risk on behalf of flight crew, since he himself did not accept it.  The Capt then informed the pedestrians that the aircraft was loaded and would be completing a take-off directly, and that they must vacate the runway and remain at least 200 feet away from the runway during the departure.  The pedestrians and their dogs moved to the north of the infield area, north of the runway, well clear of the active runway, so the departure went ahead as planned with no further incident.

2713,14-09-25 19:00,Crew,Crew/Passenger Interference,Security Situation,Occurrence,CYLW - Main Terminal,Low Risk,"Upon deplaning PAX in YLW we proceeded to do our Security Check of the aircraft.  Row 20AB we had found a knife that was concealed under the seat cushion between the two velcro straps.\r\n\r\nUpon discovering the knife the crew and CSA's had no direction on how to deal with it.  The manifest says that  Should any items be left behind by passengers be found, they must be removed from the aircraft and provided to the Customer Service Agents handling the flight to be given to the passenger, to be brought through security. This does not sound applicable to weapons, it is more if anyone left behind a bag or a book.\r\n\r\nThe CSA's have never had to deal with it before and had no direction of what to do on their side.\r\nThe FAM states  2.5.10 - The Captain will liaise with the airport security and OCC regarding the item.  Should Airport security suspect some sort of explosive device, the crew will disembark the aircraft and wait for further instructions .\r\nBoth the Captain and FO have never had any direction from OCC or flight OPS on the security procedures.  There is no procedure in the COM for finding a weapon on board, the only direction on the security check in YLW they have had was from the flight manifest and word of mouth. \r\n\r\nThe Captain brought the knife into security and handed it off.  We finished our check and loaded the aircraft.  \r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the final paperwork to be done Wayne stated  Can I get my knife back, I replied telling him that it was not possible and security was given the knife.  Upon taxiing we asked for his name, Wayne stated his name was Fred, I than asked for a piece of Identification.  He refused the piece of ID and to give me his real name.  \r\n\r\nI told him he had two options You can either show me a piece of ID or we can have security meet us in YVR and we would get it that way.  Again he refused, I returned to the back galley and filled Jake in on the situation.  It was decided that we would pull back up to the gate and have security deplane the passenger.  Security came onboard and deplaned him with no incident.  Security however, did not take notes at the time he was deplaned.  \r\n\r\nAs a note there was no  Captains Final Notice cards onboard the aircraft.",,"James Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Sept 26 2014 - handling risk high.

I inquired if they knew which passenger was seated in the seat with the knife  and questioned why they would have let a passenger who concealed a weapon back onto the aircraft.  Crew advised that they were not comfortable allowing the passenger to re-board, but were given direction by the Captain to do so. Flight Attendants were coached on the fact that this passenger could have been a further threat to themselves and other passengers, and should have been denied boarding for the second leg.

Aircraft was in descent for arrival through approx. 15,000 ft. with the autopilot engaged when the overspeed occurred and the horn sounded.  Vmo on the aircraft for this altitude is 243 KIAS.  FDM observed a 4 KIAS overspeed, consistent with the crew's report.  FDM speed is determined by selection of the onside ADC.  Crew explained they had been given a late runway change which prompted re-programming of the arrival procedure, accompanied by a Direct-To clearance to a point not previously programmed.  The First Officer was the PF and conducted the FMS re-programming.  The Captain was the PM and was observing the PF at the time of the overspeed.  Crew was counseled that although the SOP permits the PF to conduct programming above 10,000 ft., with the autopilot engaged, large or complex re-programming should normally be conducted or requested of the PM.  This allows the PF to focus primarily on the direct operation of the aircraft controls/FGC during critical phases of flight.\r\n\r\nBased on the above, the impact to safety is determined to be low and the likelihood of re-occurrence unlikely.

I called up to the pilots to let them know what was going on and they decided to turn the seatbelt sign off.\r\nAt that time at least 5 other pax got up to wait to use the bathroom and all were waiting around the flight deck door and the MCD. We made a couple of announcements to try to get them to sit down but this did not work.\r\nThe pax, by this time, had made many mentions about going to the White Spot in the YLW airport during the delay.\r\nThere were 2 pax on board that were severely intoxicated once we got up in the air(which included the friendly gentleman at the very back of the plane on the right side). \r\nThere was a pax on board (Cory McGregor) who was trying to assist Emilie and I, by having his severely intoxicated co-worker put his seatbelt on and comply with the rules. This was greatly appreciated. Efforts to keep pax under control and calm failed. We still had pax huddling at the flight deck door up until we received 10 000 chimes. After a couple calls to the cockpit the pilots made a weather announcement for YVR. At the end, they mentioned the need for passengers to stay seated. Emilie and I had to suspend in flight service and did not get commissary list or other duties done until all pax de planed in YVR, due to the fact that these pax took all of out attention and awareness the entire flight. Pax were still trying to get up and use the lav after the 10,000 chimes and before landing chimes.\r\nAfter all pax de planed and Emilie and I began Grooming we noticed the cabin smelled of urine.",The cause of this situation was the pax going to the White Spot during the one hour delay in YLW. \r\n\r\nIn the future I think it would be a good idea to inform the CSA's in YLW of our zero tolerance policy for alcohol for these types of flights. \r\nIt would be helpful to have them looking for signs of intoxication before the pax got out to the plane so that these types of situations can be avoided in the future. \r\n\r\n,"October 7 2014-1042 L CYXJ\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nHandling risk LOW 2-2\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Oct 8 2014 15:30L handling risk med 2-5 assigned to manager; to determine level of ICM.

2727,14-10-02 13:00,None,Injury- On ground- Flight Crew,,Injury,Mid Cabin DGP,Medium Risk,"When we landed in Horizon Emilie and I began to prepare the cabin for the next leg of the day. Emilie was bringing meals from the front cargo to the back to stock them into the service cart, while I was grooming the cabin. I had been tossing the garbage into the centre isle, as I had been doing all week. Emilie passed by me in the cabin with a big box of meals in her hand when she stepped on a water bottle that was underneath a news paper, causing her to loose her balance and hit her head on the overhead bin. I herd something (Emilies head coming in contact with the overhead bin) but didnt really register it as anything as my back was turned to her at that time. \r\n\r\nAfter the cabin was groomed and the meals were put away Emilie and I went inside. We had a little while until we were supposed to be boarding so I went out for a breath of fresh air while Emilie waited inside the building. Upon returning I saw Emilie sitting in a chair looking quite rattled. I asked her what was wrong and said that she looked a little shaken up. She then told me that when she hit her head she hit it pretty hard and actually threw up afterwards. \r\nAs soon as she told me this the ground staff told us it was time to board and that he was going to make an announcement. I immediately told him to hold off on that because Emilie had hit her head and I didn't feel that it was a good idea for her to fly and thought she maybe needed to get checked out. \r\nThe staff in Horizon agreed with me, and called a medic into the building to take a look at her. I went to inform the pilots of what had happened. \r\n\r\nThe medics,in the end, said that Emilie was okay. As a crew we decided it wasn't a good idea for Emilie to operate the flight due to the fact that she had thrown up and was initially feeling quite sore where she had hit her head. \r\n\r\nWe waited until SUI flew in and had Jake Simmer hop on our flight to work the 2 legs back to YVR with me.\r\n\r\nOnce on the plane and up in the air Emilie seemed fine and well but at the time I didn't want to take a chance and risk having her safety or anyone else's compromised.     ","I think the cause of this situation was that I was throwing garbage into the centre isle, when I really should have been tossing any waste into a garbage bag right away. \r\nNeedless to say won't be doing that again.","October 7 2014-1034 L CYXJ\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nHandling risk due injury indicated\r\n\r\nAndrew Matson - SMS - Oct 7, 2014  1145L\r\nThe individual involved did seek medical attention, but was not prevented from reporting to work on any day subsequent to the event.

The aircraft was crewed by Karpowich and Brownridge. Once the thumbs up was received and acknowledged from Captain Karpowich, I gave the signal to come forward towards myself to get the plane rolling and then motioned for them to turn and exit our ramp area. After the fourth signal to turn, the airplane was still heading straight towards me. I had to quickly get out of the way to avoid being struck by the plane. Eye contact was maintained throughout this occurrence. ",I was clearly visible in front of the aircraft so it was not a matter of lack of visual contact.

The deviation from clearance was immediately recognized by the flight crew, the aircraft was stopped and ATC was notified.  The event was self-reported and there has been no indication of a CADORS or operational impact.  This also does not constitute a trend; the last taxi way incursion was SMS 2455 Apr 6 2014; previous taxi deviations in the last 12 months have not been in the vicinity of Yankee vs. Charlie intersections while taxiing on rwy 26.  Last taxi deviation for NCA in this vicinity was SMS 1296 Sept 13 2011.  Based on review, does not need to be reported to Transport Canada.\r\n\r\nNov 5 2014\r\nDeborah Kominko Assistant Chief Pilot 703/704\r\nspoke with captain on day of occurrence. Event occurred during hours of darkness. After passing the sign for Y taxiway, the flight crew were unsure of their position. The only sign visible at that point is the sign for C, indicating that the C taxiway is after the sign. However, the flight crew mistakenly believed that the taxi way sign indicated that the C taxiway was in front of the sign, and so inadvertently turned onto Y. The flight crew even looked down the taxiway prior to turning onto it, to see if they could see signs indicating which taxiway it was, but were unable to see a sign. Shortly after turning onto Y, a sign came into view indicating they were on Y, not C, and so the flight crew stopped and informed ATC. They were instructed to continue their taxi. \r\n\r\nThis is a human Factors Error, of the type Thinking Error, Rule based mistake. A contributing factor was the night time operation.\r\n\r\nIn review, the impact to safety management and the likelihood of reoccurrence is determined to be low.  This investigation has been reviewed and determined to be managed to As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP), and meets the SMS requirements for a root cause analysis.  The cause has been determined to be a human error and unintentional deviation from a single standard, procedure or process.

In discussion, it is reasonable to assume that the Flight Attendant became complacent and focused on the removal of the waste and not completing the door disarming cycle.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of procedural drift, complacency and loss of focus on the task at hand. The operating 2LR Flight Attendant has undergone a remedial slide door arming & disarming one-on-one training session (Drill Booklet attached). Furthermore, the Flight Attendant has been counseled on importance of following all safety procedures, prior to entertaining any service procedures, and additionally techniques for visual confirmation on door arming & disarming.\r\n\r\nThe resulting impact to safety management and the likelihood of re occurrence is determined to be low.

Likely determination of cause was likely the result of insufficient amount of Type IV anti-icing fluid used; which was half the amount that the Anti-Icing provider recommended.  We have specific de-icing and anti-icing fluid procedures including proper techniques send to icing service providers.  \r\n\r\nHowever, NCA operations does not currently have a procedure to determine minimum fluid used that is a reasonable amount per the fluid manufacturer to ensure proper fluid coverage.  Pilots copy the fluid used amounts, but this does not relate to assessing whether the fluid amount used was appropriate per the manufacturer.  I am using pro-active SMS process to highlight that this is not done by NCA.  It is now a recommendation by the TSB to address fluid amounts.  The amount used by the manufacturer of the type IV is 1 to 1.5 Litres of fluid per Sq. M of critical surface area to be anti-iced.\r\n\r\n\r\nPer past discussion with SMS, I am making recommendation this be addressed by flight operations to educate flight crews to have criteria for minimum/maximum fluid types for their aircraft, and recommend that Ramp/airports give criteria for our icing service providers.

October 28, 2014\r\nI have confirmed that there was a brake rider and that this has been confirmed by both the Ramp Lead as well as Patric Houghton (NCA AME). In conversations with the ramp lead it has been determined that while the ramp was positioning aircraft in Hangar 5 and 6 for maintenance both, the flight crew and OCC, made numerous calls to the ramp to reposition GNJ in a better spot for departure. This was not immediately possible, as there was only 2 ramp attendants on at that time of the morning and they were both moving SUI for maintenance. \r\nThe following is the email I received from Patrick\r\nMorning Trevor,\r\nWas talking for Bobby this evening and he brought to my attention a SMS report that was filed regarding GNJ's Oct 28, 2014 early morning ramp movements prior to its 3:45AM departure.\r\nThere appears to be some discrepancy between what was reported and what occurred regarding brake accumulator pressure during the ramp movements.\r\nEarlier that evening, I conducted a Line Check on the aircraft. In order to accurately measure brake wear, the park brake accumulator is charged to 2000 PSI. When assisting Bobby and Nate in moving the aircraft out of hangar 6 in anticipation for departure, the brake pressure was at 2000 PSI. The aircraft was placed by hangar 4 in order to facilitate placing SUI in hangar 6 and other aircraft into hangar 5. I noticed GNJ's Co-Pilot coming out to the aircraft, and as a courtesy, I charged the brake accumulator from around 1300 PSI to ~1800 PSI. This is also required in our Pre-Departure Inspections, of which I helped accomplish on GNJ.\r\nI understand some minor-heated-discussion was had between GNJ's crew and ramp personnel that morning regarding GNJ's initial position. I myself was aware the aircraft was to be re-positioned after SUI was placed in hangar 6. Nevertheless, it would be highly unlikely that the aircraft was repositioned with insufficient brake pressure as I had just charged it prior to it's final positioning.\r\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to contact me in person, or give me a shout via 403-472-5733.

We discussed our options and with full mains we would have enough fuel on board to go to CAL4 the next day. Because we were repositioning to Signature we decided to have EFC meet us at Signature and fill the aux tanks. The fueller from EFC was the same person who filled us up previously and stated that the aux tanks were full. Jason opened the cap to the left aux tank and saw fuel on the anti-siphon valve and agreed the mains were full. I asked him to check the right one and he said it was the same. At this point we decided we had a faulty indicator on both aux tanks and MEL'd them in co-ordination with CYYC maintenance. Once airborne we noticed both aux tanks were not transferring. I consulted the MEL which had a maintenance procedure if the aux tanks were not working and decided we needed to go back to CYEG as not to ground the plane in CYBF. Later in CYEG, maintenance told us that the aux tanks were empty. I asked Jason what he had saw in the aux tanks, and he said he saw fuel on the anti-siphon valves but did not push them down to fully check.  The fueller from EFC was adamant that the aux tanks were full and Jason believed that they were as well when he saw fuel on the anti-siphon valves. Our decision to return to CYEG was based on the side of safety and not to ground the airplane in CYBF with the information that we had at the time.","EFC did not properly fill the aircraft as requested, and Jason was in belief of the fueller when he saw fuel on the anti-siphon valve, and did not push it down to fully check.","November 4 2014-858 L CYXJ\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nHandling risk MED 3-3 due process failure\r\nIn my opinion the actual risk Med 2-3\r\nA defect was entered in the log book and a MEL applied by the crew.\r\nMaintenance inspected the aircraft found no defects TC142690-4 and -5 and released the work\r\nNo further maintenance action required\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Nov 4 2014 - handling risk med for process failure assigned to manager for review.  changed from cockpit indication to operations procedures\r\n\r\nNov 19 2014\r\nDeborah Kominko Assistant Chief Pilot 703/704\r\nSee attached report for description of issue.

2778,14-11-04 5:50,Ground Support Equipment,Third Party Actions ,Ground Equipment,Occurrence,apron 4,Low Risk,"During the push back of AC 591, flight 1712. Once the AC came to a full stop we received clearance to disconnect the tow bar and pull the by pass pin, after we disconnected we cleared the flight crew to start engines 2 and 1 at their discretion as per our training. I informed the captain we would be disconnecting the headset and we would be switching to hand signals. At this point both engines were started and the headset was disconnected. As I was driving away the Canadian North tug died. There has been an ongoing issue with the air box kill switch which causes the tug to stop running. To restart the tug requires two people, one to hold the engine cover up and another to reach down into the engine block to reset the air box switch. This happened twice this morning on the same flight and AC while we were still connected. The third time the tug died it stopped under the nose in a blind spot for the flight crew, requiring both the marshaller s to leave their positions to come and reset the switch. This resulted with the tug dead in a blind spot with all three ground crew occupied. Gary did give the captain the stop hand signal before leaving eye contact. We were able to get the tug started again and the flight left with no further incidents. ",There has been an ongoing problem with Canadian North's tug. Canadian North maintenance is aware of the problem as well as Sid from Canadian North. It may have been a non issue for their maintenance department as they do not move the AC with the intent of starting the engines.  However with the new operations at 393 we are now using the tug for push backs and the issue of the tug air-box shut off is causing what i believe to be a safety concern.,"James Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Nov 4 2014 9:27 - handling risk low 2-2 assigned to manager.

Jack determined that the secondary low oil pressure Murphy switch that prevents engine operation was faulty. This system is also used for an alternate way to shut down the Tug if the Fuel Cutoff was not able to kill the engine. Our short term corrective action has been to disable the faulty airbox cut off solenoid, so that this item is no longer able to kill the engine. The Tug has now been placarded to indicate this system is inoperative. The Tug is still able to be controlled via the Fuel Cutoff.\r\nAnecdotally, Jack Crowle did say that he had previously disabled that system as it was acting up before, and was surprised to see it was reactivated. I have directed our staff to placard the deactivated part so that it is clear that that system has been deactivated to enhance safety.\r\nAs this is a piece of ground equipment, the secondary system is surplus to requirement for operation. The long term preventative action to prevent the system from activating is to leave it disabled.

Myself and Jana went into the terminal to go use the bathroom and help with boarding. The pilots stayed on board and monitored the exits. Jana was escorting a preboard into the aircraft as Christopher Martell (the pax who got off) was walking away, unescorted, and into the terminal building. I was inside ready to bring the general boarding guys out when myself and the gate agent, Aleia Enders, noticed him walking into the terminal building. I went to confront him and all he said was I heard what you guys were saying and I knew you guys were going to talk to me to get off. We were extremely confused because no on had talked with him. So I escorted him into the building and the gate agent got his name and bag number and his bag was offloaded. Here is what the CSA, Aleia Enders emailed me when she confronted the passenger... \r\n\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nSo after the flight took off I saw him in arrivals and I went to talk to him. He said the reason he got off was because he heard the crew talking and laughing about him and his bag.

When the aircraft was moved it was winter storm conditions and with the flat light it was very difficult to see the snow pile that the aircraft came into contact with.  He did notice that the aircraft was touching the snow bank at informed maintenance about the incident, but was informed to not worry about it that that aircraft is just going to be pop cans. I have deemed this as an issue that could only happen to this particular aircraft as all other air worthy aircraft would never be parked on the grass and thus not run the risk of contacting the snow pile. As for the cut tire the same individual was attempting to place parking barriers on either side of the nose gear to eliminate the possibility of the aircraft wind cocking due to the fact that it is light with most of the components being removed and not having any brakes (this was identified in a previous SMS report). The Individual that cut the tire again told maintenance and was again told that it was not a problem and to not worry about it. I have had a discussion with all the ramp agents and they have been informed that they are to treat the RJ-85 as they would any other aircraft in the fleet. I have also talked with Mark Wright and he is going to have discussions with his leads to disseminate proper information about the RJ-85 with all his maintenance staff. This investigation reflects the cause as a human error and unintentional deviation from standard procedure(s) and the individual was given all appropriate training and procedures, but failed to carry out this single task as required.  The impact to safety is low and the likelihood of reoccurrence is unlikely (low risk).

In a case like this we where in an AOG situation and the part was shipped to us without notification that it was beyond inspection date.  In situation like this it is up to us to confirm serviceability of part before install.  Since then our stores have completed a review of altimeter devices in stores and ensured that there is a life limit requirement on them. During receiving it will be advised a life limit is required. In this situation the part being drop shipped to Vancouver bypassing are usual store receiving procedure, and with no notification the part was past inspection from vendor left us in an out of normal situation.

The marshaller was standing a safe distance away for normal operations but if the brakes ever released or the aircraft happened to skid, the ramphand would be run over and likely killed. Marshaller was briefed on the importance of personal safety and to get out of the way if that happens. ",Pilot did not attempt other solutions like the breaking brakes free training course shows and the ramphand's inexperience and want to do the job kept him there when he should have moved.

Dec 1, 2014\r\nUpon reviewing this report I have determined that although NCA does not have a passenger pylon policy it is the norm to place them out to facilitate the safe movement of passengers. Unfortunately due to the parking places available for Boeing aircraft at 580 Palmer Rd, it is impossible to to string out these pylons prior to the commencement of boarding and off loading passenger as having pylons across the ramp deems the ramp not usable for all other aircraft. If it is determined that this is a requirement of Canadian North it is up to the CSA and Flight Attendants to hold passengers and communicate this requirement to the ramp attendants as they may not know that the CSA are commencing the boarding of an aircraft. The same can be said for arriving aircraft as pylons are a FOD hazard and can not be place prior to the arrival of an aircraft. The decision to board  and off load passengers is strictly under control of Canadian North employees, it is up to CN employees to ensure all company safety measures are in place prior to having passengers on the ramp.\r\nRFC\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk- Dec 5 2014 2014-Q/A Manager\r\nI have reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found; a.

Original copy and email maintained on file in SMS office.\r\n\r\nAt approx 14:35 Craig Schnell (YEG Enbridge Pilot) informed me about a NCA aircraft with it's tail very close to hangar #3 doors.  Craig was in the process of opening the large hangar door when he noticed the aircraft and how close the tail of the aircraft (C-FNNC) was to the hangar door.  The tail was close enough that Craig thought he would damage the a/c if he continued to open door.  Craig saw lights on in the cockpit of the a/c.  He went to the front of the a/c and signaled to the two pilots inside not to start the a/c.  \r\n\r\nCraig returned to the hangar door and closed it.  Shortly after he closed the hangar door the pilots started their a/c.  The a/c ran in it's current position for approx 3 min then taxi'd away.  I have the camera footage showing how close the tail was to the hangar door as well as the positioning of the a/c on the attache flash drive.\r\n\r\nI went back and reviewed the camera footage for the month of Nov 2014 and found two other instances.  7:50am Wed Nov 19th and 06:35am Tuesday Nov 15th.\r\n\r\nThere are several safety concerns in regards to a/c being positioned, started and running in this location:\r\n1. Possible harm to individuals opening man door on hangar #3 from debris/jet blast.\r\n2. Aircraft exhaust is being directly pushed into the hangar via jet blast then enters into the employee offices.\r\n3. Damage to the hangar doors from the jet blast\r\n4.

Unless the aircraft had been parked while the door was open it is not possible for the door to come into contact with the aircraft. As for wind damage while opening hangar door this will always be a concern with an active apron. Even with the memo about parking aircraft parallel to the hangar doors, when the aircraft turns out toward the taxiway there will still be the possibility of wind damage. As someone that is operating the hangar door, that individual must be aware about what is going on out on the ramp prior to the door being opened.

Although the tug was being moved at a safe speed the position of where the aircraft was being parked forced the tug to be on the edge of the hangar door (door tracks). This caused the tug to be dealing with snow and ice build up as it is difficult to remove snow and ice from that particular transition area between the ramp and hangar. With the door being opened and closed there tends to be a bit of ice build up. This contributed to the tug slipping when the brakes were applied.\r\n2. Inexperience of the ramp attendants. The attendant that was watching the side with the damaged static wick has been with the company for 2 months and does not have the experience to know to not let an aircraft get that close that a static wick could be damaged. It appeared that he focused on one area of the win tip and did not look at the overall big picture. \r\nThis investigation reflects the cause as a human error and unintentional deviation from standard procedure(s) and the individual was given all appropriate training and procedures, but failed to carry out this single task as required.  The impact to safety is low and the likelihood of reoccurrence is unlikely (low risk).  This investigation has investigated the occurrence and has determined it to be managed to As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP), although it meets the SMS formal requirements for a root cause analysis, this statement constitutes a root-cause analysis.  It has also been determined this decision was not affected by an external influence, which could have contributed to the decisions made by the individual.  The originator has self-reported this deviation to record the event and to allow the organization to review for possible improvement.

The ladder is not to be used to unload bags with, it is there to only provide access to the cargo area in the 1900's.

As I increased the pressure on the brakes they immediately locked up due to compacted snow & ice on the ramp, the tug began to slide towards the side of the number three & four engines. As soon as the tug began to slide I immediately radioed Trenton to apply the brakes in SUA.

Medium risk for both assigned to managers as required; (2) to be reviewed by secondary investigator\r\n\r\nTrevor Smith, Senior Supervisor of Airports, Dec 11, 2014\r\nI have talk asked Nathanael Dirks to be the primary on this investigation as Corey was working on Oxygen bottle for Maintenance in YXJ. I also want his in site on the use of personnel vehicles for company work in FSJ. Changed primary investigator to Nathanael Dirks.\r\n\r\nDec 23 2014\r\nDeborah Kominko Assistant Chief Pilot\r\nIssue #1\r\nBoth sets of keys are routinely given out during winter months, as this vehicle does not have command start. This enables the driver to start the car/truck to warm it up, and keep it locked. The second set is used to unlock the vehicle. Unfortunately, the pilot that was given both sets of keys forgot to return them before leaving YXJ. They have since been returned to YXJ. Phil Enns does have a third set, but he was not in this day.\r\n\r\nThis is a human factors error, of the type Action Error, Lapse. The hazard in this case is that by not being able to drive the shop truck, the employee chose to drive his own vehicle, leading to facility damage. Ordinarily, forgetting to return keys is not a safety hazard in and of itself. \r\n\r\nIn review, the impact to safety management and the likelihood of reoccurrence (of forgetting to return keys) is determined to be low.  This investigation has been reviewed and determined to be managed to As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP), and meets the SMS requirements for a root cause analysis.  The cause has been determined to be a human error and unintentional deviation from a single standard, procedure or process.  The individual was provided all appropriate training on these procedures, but failed to carry out the requirement of this single task.  My investigation has determined this decision was not affected by an external or environmental influence, which could have contributed to the decision made by the individual(s).  This situation as reported has not occurred within the framework of recent guidance.   The report has been reviewed with the originator and they have been made aware of the significance or impacts of this event.\r\n\r\nFlight ops review complete. \r\n\r\nJan 6, 2015\r\nNathanael Dirks, Base Engineer YXJ\r\n\r\nUpon review of the evidence it appears that the root cause of the vehicle colliding with the hangar is a combination of driving too fast for the conditions and unconventional driving practices. The long skid marks show that the vehicle was driving too fast to stop in a reasonable amount of time. \r\nThe unconventional driving is referring to the fact that the vehicle was being driven around the hangar in reverse. Driving in this way would cause the vehicle to react differently to steering inputs, and cause braking to be less effective. It also decreases visibility and makes control more awkward. This would be the cause of 'the front end of truck begun to slide sideways as it came off the gravel parking lot slope onto the ramp'. I have discussed driving practices with Corey Friesen, and explained the hazards of driving in reverse as listed above, as well as the need to drive with extra caution when the ramp is slippery.\r\n\r\nI have attached a corrective action plan document with the root cause analysis.\r\nThis concludes my investigation. \r\nPrimary investigation returned to Trevor Smith for review.\r\n\r\nTrevor Smith, Senior Supervisor of Airports, Jan 7, 20165\r\nReviewed\r\nRFC\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 14 2015  Vern Lace- Q/A Manager maintenance \r\nI have reviewed and determined that this investigation and supporting documentation and found;\r\na.

I removed the panels on #1 engine intake lip as I thought it was part of the inspection. (turned out it actually was not but that is beside the point). Under those panels are the engine fire extingusher bottles. On the Outboard one I discovered the discharge pipe with the squibs was not attached to the fire extingusher bottle. Had someone attempted to discharge the bottle, a hole would have been shot through the cowl as the squib fired and the extinguishent not discharged into the engine. \r\n\r\nPlease find photo attached. \r\n\r\nTC# 143007-9 was raised to address the issue. ","The gland nut on the discharge line was either a) not attached to begin with, b)it was attached but not tighened up (the other end of the pipe was attached but could easily be turned by fingers), or c) as it was not lockwired backed itself off until it was no longer attached. \r\n\r\nI personally am going with either a or b in my opinion.\r\n\r\nWe then proceeded to check all the other fire extinguishers on the engines to make sure they were all attached.

The other fire bottles on the aircraft were also removed for weigh check at the same time.\r\n\r\nMy investigation has shown that each fire bottle replacement was correctly certified and the job cards fully completed with reference to the relevant AMMs together with the component change details. This would mean that the C certifier at the end of the check would be unlikely to have any concerns about the correct completion of the job.\r\n\r\nThe mechanic and certifying engineer who carried out the tasks left CAM of their own free will some months ago and are therefore not available to be interviewed to get their side of the story. I can confirm that the engineer who certified the task was current on type and has many years of aircraft engineering experience. He is also personally known to other members of the engineering team here at CAM and we are all very surprised that he would have made such a significant error in certifying a task that was not, it would seem, complete. I may further add that his continuation training was current and was authorised by CAM to certify this task.\r\n\r\nI note that your work order TC143007-009 acts as corrective action for the occurrence.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that an event of this nature has happened at CAM, so I thank you for bringing this to our attention.

There is no interchangeability between 50-389121-21 and 50-389121-31 pressure switches. Both switches are also marked on their cases of having different closing pressures.\r\n\r\nIn addition, with the incorrect switch, Autofeather operation would have been affected. \r\n\r\n","The initial behaviour was observed T/C 142677-217 on November 19, 2014. Further troubleshooting and rectifications were carried out on T/C's 142677-220, 222, 223 - none of which included checking the applicable pressure switch. \r\n\r\nThe incorrect pressure switch was installed Ref: T/C 142677-223.

Previous repairs completed, 142677-220, 222, and 223. This pressure switch was installed on TC 142677-223, and now repaired on TC 142677-2229, these two TC attached.\r\nA 1900C pressure switch was installed, this switch operates at a lower pressure than the 1900D pressure switches.  This caused the auto-ignition system to turn off early.  The previous troubleshooting completed was on annunciator system, finally a defective pressure switch was found, and replaced with incorrect part. The aircraft was moved to YYC for unrelated scheduled maintenance.  This defect was snagged again.  And it was discovered the incorrect pressure switch was installed. \r\nCompleted a review of stores and found more of the -31 pressure switches in YYC inventory, reviewed IPC for 1900â€™s and King Airâ€™s these pressure switches are only used on 1900C that we do not operate any more.  These parts have been removed from inventory and put into quarantine.  To hopefully stop this from happening again, with this part. \r\nAfter speaking with engineer that installed the incorrect pressure switch, it was an error pulling parts from stores, the bin had several pressure switches in it, and simply grabbed the -31, instead of the -21.  Engineer advised that the pressure actuation point was checked before install, as printed on the label.  And it was the correct one.  However the pressure switch removed from aircraft in YYC is labeled clearly as -31 actuation point is 4.7 PSI.  Not the 8.33 for a 1900D.   \r\nRecommend the remaining investigation transferred to Ken Pratt for completion.  \r\n\r\nKen Pratt December 19/14- Attached CAP to report.

Part one is the incorrect pressure switch was grabbed from stores.  This is human factors action error slip.  there where many pressure switches in the bin that all look alike, simply grabbed the -31 instead of the -21.  To further the error an incomplete handover was left for the work in progress.  At time of handover all that remained was a ground run of the aircraft to check the auto-ignition system. The engineer did a simple ground run of one engine to check the arming light came on, and that was it.  In this instance a more comprehensive ground run to check both engines, and both the auto-ignition, and auto-feather system since this pressure switch works for both systems should have been completed.  A more comprehensive ground run would have revealed the pressure switch was not arming at the correct time.  This information was not communicated in the handover.   \r\nHave counseled the engineer on the importance of complete handovers, in this case a verbal handover was done, and not written down in the handover book.

The dayâ€™s flights were scheduled to be completed by 18:36z. The first 2 legs of the morning were completed, on schedule with no delays. Throughout the day, we kept hourly contact with OCC to keep them informed that our passengers had not arrived on schedule and that the flight was continually being delayed. At 22:30 OCC decided to route us direct back to Calgary, rather than continuing to Medicine Hat providing that the passengers show up in a reasonable amount of time. I informed OCC that I would contact Dispatch immediately and have them draw up a flight plan for us to come direct back to Calgary. They told me that they would quickly put that together for me and email it out. Passengers had arrived at 22:40 and I had asked Nathan and Jana to go ahead and begin loading the passengers and their baggage, prep the aircraft for departure, and that I would be out shortly as soon as the flight plans come in. By 23:00z, I had still not received the flight plans so I quickly called dispatch and was informed that he (Luke) was told by OCC to stand down and that they would update him when they figured out a plan for the trip back. I immediately got on the phone with OCC to let them know and to get them to call dispatch immediately. I had received the flight plan at 23:14. This miscommunication had caused us another 25 minute delay. We were wheels up at 23:18, providing us the time that we needed to return to Calgary within our 14hr duty day. Upon arrival into Calgary, through about 16,000 ft on the Flaam4 Arrival we had to reduce speed to Vb of 180kts due to moderate to severe turbulence. We remained at that speed throughout the arrival. At the end of the STAR we were kept on Vectors to the north for a bit longer than normal, due to other traffic on approach. Once cleared for the approach, upon interception of localizer, we were restricted to 160kts to SARCEE beacon crossing.

Alex proceeded to open the front left cabin door.  As the door opened, Sydney saw something drop out from the slide cover and simultaneously noticed a flap that said Pull.  At the same time, Alex noticed that something felt weird with the door, while Sydney remarked to Alex to confirm again if the door was disarmed.  By this point the slide hard started to inflate and Syndey yelled to Alex to kick it.  Alex pushed the door out and kicked the slide out through the door.  The slide fully inflated outside the aircraft, and fell to the ground, sliding about 15 to 20 feet away from the aircraft as it inflated.  The slide was not attached to the airframe when it inflated, and the girt bar was not engaged, hence why the slide ended up 15 to 20 feet away.\r\n\r\nNobody was injured or hit by the slide as it inflated and dislodged from the airframe.\r\n\r\nOCC, MOC and Canadian North Dispatch were called, as well as the on call CP.

The information regarding pieces of  broken yellow found on the galley floor, leads me to think that the girt bar did not retract completely / properly when disarmed, thus catching part of the aircraft frame and causing the slide to inflate.

Haresh explained to me that he had began to walk toward teh main gear from his wing walking position as he saw that the main gear was getting close to the taxi light. He attempted to tell Cassaundra that she was getting close to the taxi light via radio but she continued to push the plane in the same direction. Haresh then proceed to panic and put his foot behind the wheel to act as a chock to keep the wheel from hitting the taxi light. Haresh has now been coached that under no circumstances is he to ever risk bodily injury to stop a plan and that he should have used the air horns whistles and lighted wands to communication under low light conditions, as using radios is not an accepted form of communication while wing walking.\r\n\r\nTrevor Smith, Senior Supervisor of Airports, Dec 17, 2014\r\nIn conversation with Cassandra, regarding the events on Dec 14, 2014. Cassandra was requested to park DGP in an unusual parking direction to facilitate a ground run. Cassandra was asked to have the aircraft tailed toward  run up bay Mike. Cassandra had Haresh visually during the entire movement but visibility was limited by lack of light. The only indication that something had happened to Hares was his screams over teh radio. I have coached Cassandra that she had done nothing wrong but that she has to ensure that all wing walking staff are using whistles or air horns and that use of radios for communication while wing walking is not acceptable.\r\nI had a discussion with Octavio Salazar about incident on Dec 14, 2014. He had requested that DGP be pulled out of the hangar and placed in Boeing position 1 with the talk painted toward run-up bay Mike. Octavio was asked to brake ride as required by NCA policy. Octavio could not see anything leading up to the incident but when he realized that there was something wrong, he exited the aircraft to help free Haresh and help clam down Cassandra. As for the in ability to move the aircraft, it was not an issue with the tug being too small. When the aircraft rolled into the area around the taxi light area it sunk 3 to 4 inched into the cold pack asphalt and became wedged. The PSI tug (NCA's largest tug) was not able to pull it out. To move this aircraft from the position the CN push back tug had to be used.\r\nAttach email from OCC with timelines around event on Dec 14, 2014\r\nKathleen Whelen has been informed and has been in contact with Haresh to confirm all WCB paper work has been filled out.\r\nThis investigation reflects the cause as a human error and unintentional deviation from standard procedure(s) and the individual was given all appropriate training and procedures, but failed to carry out this single task as required.

2878,14-12-16 16:00,BE 200,Operations procedures,System or Process Failure,Occurrence,During take off roll CYKY,High Risk,"Tim - PF, Mark - PM\r\n\r\nDuring the take off roll at approx 70 kts, Mark began to have airspeed fluctuations. Initially the airspeed appeared to come alive as normal, however around 70kts the indications became erratic. My airspeed indications were normal. Although we were below V1/Vr, I elected to continue the take off. The field in CYKY is only 3500' long and had some ice and snow patches. By the time the problem became apparent, I did not feel that stopping on the remaining runway was a safe option, as the possibility of over-run was very real at that point. As soon as we became airborne and were climbing away safely, we confirmed the pitot heat was on, but there were no other troubleshooting options to solve the problem in flight. We opted to divert back to CYYC for maint instead of continuing to CYQF. The remainder of the flight was completed without incident. Upon landing I discovered the pitot tube cover was still in place over the left hand pitot tube, however the remove before flight tag was not present. \r\n\r\nAs a indication of how difficult it was to see the plug with no tag, we had 3 ground handlers and both myself and Mark walk by the aircraft several times without noticing it. It was only when I went to actively look into the pitot tube to see if there was an obstruction that I noticed the cover.","Since I was acting as f/o, I was the one who removed the plugs in CYKY. I noted that only one pitot cover was present when I removed them. I searched the immediate area but could not find the missing one. I thought it must have blown off, as it was fairly windy on the ground. In reality, the remove before flight tag had blown off but the pitot cover was still on the pitot tube. Since the type of pitot cover used in CGM is black rubber that fits snugly over the pitot tube, it was not easily visible with the remove before flight tag missing. It did not occur to me that the tag would have blown off with the cover still attached, so my efforts at that point were focused on finding the missing cover. I have seen plugs blown off in the past due to wind, but never the tag only. \r\n\r\nThe tag was secured by metal ring on the end of the cover. I would speculate that when removing the cover, people generally pull it off by the remove before flight tag, which would have weakened the metal ring over time.\r\n\r\nRegarding our decision to continue take off with a pitot/static issue, I noticed in CYYC that the plug had some small holes in it, which explains why we got normal airspeed indications initially. If airspeed had been 0 during the roll, the problem would have been obvious with plenty of time to reject.","December 17 2014-957 L CYXJ\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nFlight ops Q/A to determine risk\r\nAssigned to manager\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt ops Dec 17 2014  -10:55 - handling risk high 4-3.

2886,14-12-18 10:30,DHC-8,Ramp/Parking/Maneuvering,Ramp Procedures,Occurrence,Hanger 1,High Risk,"I was on the tug, with Brennan on the Left side wing-walking and John on the right. We were pulling HNC out of the back of the Hanger, and as such we needed to pass the left wing over Hawker MFB and B1900 NSN. There were appropriate wing walkers and everyone had their whistles ready to use. I had earplugs in at the time of the incident, because the back-up horn is so loud on the eagle tug.\r\n\r\nThe Left wing was passing over the front top antenna of the B1900 when Brennan blew his whistle and signaled me to stop. Even though I was moving the aircraft slowly, I did not react in time and the left wing boot came in contact with the antenna. Because I was moving slowly at the time, the antenna did not receive any forceful contact from the wing.

2888,14-12-18 16:00,BE 200,Aerodrome - Equipment,,Occurrence,CYEG RAMP,Low Risk,I called for full mains for CGM at 1450 lcl in CYEG. Arriving back at the airport from the split 1515 lcl I reworked the flight planning and no longer required fuel. After I called to cancel with EFC they called me back stating CGM was currently being fuelled. with the ramp insight I told the dispatcher that my airplane CGM did not have a fuel truck near it however CGC was taking on fuel. The dispatcher said she confirmed the uplift was for CGC not CGM however when I first called she confirmed the airplane being refuel was CGM as per my request. I  believe the fuel order was given correctly which was confirmed by my captain who overheard the call. I believe EFC simply got the airplane registrations mixed up since they were clearly confused about which aircraft was being fuelled. ,communication error on behalf of EFC,"December 19 2014-840 L CYXJ\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nHandling risk low1-4\r\nAssigned to manager\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Dec 19 2014 - handling risk low 1-3 assigned to manager\r\n\r\nDec 23 2014\r\nDeborah Kominko Assistant Chief Pilot 703/704\r\nReport reviewed.

At this point, it is not possible to determine where the miscommunication occurred, therefore it is not possible to determine how the error occurred.

2891,14-12-17 21:00,BE 200,Airspace/Clearance Deviation,,Occurrence,CRL4,High Risk,Hi Tom\r\n\r\nAs we were doing the Rnav 08 in CRL4 we knew the weather at or below minimums. Ops gave us instructions to head to CET2 in the event of the miss. In the gps we had MUVUD for the the Rnav 09 for CET2 in the flight plan.\r\n\r\nDoing the approach in to CRL4 we picked up moderate to severe icing.  We reach our missed approach point and called no joy at that point my principle concern was to get back above the cloud at 5000 to get rid of the ice asap before trying to get in to CET2.\r\n\r\nIn doing so and going direct to MUVUD in Nav mode with the auto pilot and getting the plane cleaned up and trying to brief the 09 approach to CET2 we heard sunwest traffic departing 27 In CET2 at our arrival time we realized that we were going to have conflict and had to land 27 in CET2 and had remove the 09 approach and brief for the other side \r\n\r\nIn doing and going direct  MUVUD the aircraft put us in a right turn given my concerns about getting rid of the ice and traffic in CET2 I completely forgot about the airspace to the south of CRL4 and I didn't question the plane turning us to the right.\r\n\r\nThis is my fault and accept full responsibility.

The flight crew had discussed during the arrival (prior to commencing the approach, level below 7000 ft) that given the amount of icing accumulating on the airframe, they would not fly the published missed approach procedure, as that would take them back through the icing. Instead they elected to fly runway heading until they were back in the clear (cloud tops were at 5000 ft), and then manoevre for ET2. After reaching clear air, the flight crew then commenced the turn for MUVUD. While in the turn, they heard the other aircraft departing ET2, towards MUVUD.

2915,15-01-14 3:10,B 1900D,Crew- Duty Day (Unforeseen Circumstances),,Occurrence,On ground in CYMM,Low Risk,"14-hour maximum duty day was exceeded by eight (8) minutes due to unforeseen operational circumstances.  This was primarily due to our fuel uplift in CYYC being delayed by approximately 25-30 minutes due to being unable to get through to EFC on the phone (kept getting a busy signal, which typically doesn't happen).  I (Corey Young) eventually had to go out to the ramp and track down an EFC fueler, who was fueling another company aircraft, in order to get our fuel uplift request in to them.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching cruise after departing from CYYC (note: longer taxi time to Runway 35R for departure), I re-calculated our expected duty completion time based on ETA for CYMM.  Taking into account expected ground repositioning time following arrival at CYMM (note: passengers to be deplaned at North Terminal, then aircraft to be repositioned to EFC FBO for overnight parking), I estimated that we would exceed our 14-hour duty day limit by approximately 5-15 minutes, including the 15 minutes required for post-flight duties following final engines off.  Both crew members discussed this and were in agreement with exceeding 14 hours due to the circumstances.  I (Corey Young) then spoke with Trevor Dallman in CYYC, via company VHF frequency, to verify that the circumstances were acceptable for an extension to maximum flight duty time due to unforeseen operational circumstances.  He concurred.\r\n\r\nFor both crew members:\r\n\r\nPlanned duty day start: 13:15Z\r\nActual duty day start: 13:15Z\r\n\r\nPlanned duty day end: 03:00Z (13 hours, 45 minutes)\r\nActual duty day end: 03:23Z (14 hours, 8 minutes) (* See note below)\r\n\r\n* Note:  Aircraft time in following arrival at CYMM, was  02:54Z.  Following passengers being deplaned, aircraft was repositioned to EFC FBO, with a final engines off (time in) time of 03:08Z.  With the 15 minutes added for post-flight duties, this brought our duty completion time to 03:23Z.\r\n\r\n~ C.

We notified CPT Toews of the situation and notified the CSA's. Because we didn't know who was sitting there we did not who brought them on board. Cpt Toews told us to see if he would sit in the same seat and look for them. And if he did to talk with him and let him know that he should have told us after the multiple announcements we made about letting us know if there are any items in possession that would be prohibited through security and that we would put it in their checked bags. During this time we would keep the saw blades in the flight deck with the pilots for the YLW - YVR leg. We boarded and the passenger sitting in 17C was not the same passengers as on the previous leg. So we, as a crew, that we would make an announcement after we had opened our main cabin door in YVR. \r\n\r\nAfter landing in YVR I made an announcement to confirm to passengers to let us know if they have anything as anything left on board is a security risk and that if someone had left something on board the aircraft that they could pick it up at the arrivals door. I opened the main cabin door and grabbed the saw blades. I stood at the door and a passenger came and grabbed them. I told him that doing that is a huge security risk and if he was to do it again he may be denied boarding. He nodded his head and I asked for his name. He mumbled something and than walked inside. I tried to stop him but I was told I was not aloud to walk in as I may not be aloud out by a ground agent. I than asked one of the ground agents to go inside and grab the passenger's name. By the time I talked with one I found out I could go inside. So I went inside looking for him but he must have had one of the first bags off the aircraft. I proceeded outside where a group of the guys were standing with the same hoodie as the guy that left the saw blades on board. I asked them about the gentlemen in question and a guy confirmed where he was sitting and they gave me his name, Ante Ukalovic.

I was completing the After Take off Checklist through 3500'AGL when I noticed the 3 red gear lights with the handle still lit.

In charge FA also contacted us to advise the gear was not retracted.  After completing the QRH actions the issue was not corrected. I alerted ATC to our issue and requested 15000' ASL as our final altitude with a revised speed. There is no satellite phone in GNJ so we were not able to call MOC or Canadian North Dispatch.  Weather in Kelowna was not suitable for return.  After Debs and I discussed the weather, icing en route, fuel requirements, terrain and access to maintenance; we elected to continue to our destination of Lethbridge and contact YYC MOC en route when in range rather than proceeding to our take off alternate of Vancouver.  I advised the In charge FA of the plan and made a passenger announcement.  After about 15-20 minutes in cruise.  I was scanning the cockpit as I usually do and noticed I must have left the Alternate Gear Extension Door open when dropping the main gear doors for the morning walk around.

I replied if it was a mechanic and she was not sure.  I went to check myself and went on board. I looked down the aircraft and had not seen anyone.  I asked the groomer where was this man she had mentioned. She said last back row. I looked carefully and had only seen a silhouette of a jacket plumped over the last row barely visible.  I had approached slowly and had actually seen a man slouched down like he was either asleep or looked dead.  I asked the man to state his business here and no response so I poked him with my finger and he raised his head and had looked intoxicated or under the influence.  I had asked him again to state his business and why he was on board our aircraft.  He muttered some words in a different language.  So I immediately began to call my 2 ramp guys to come up to escort this gentleman out of the aircraft. Again he was at a slouch state when my guys came on board.  My 2 guys asked what he was doing here and of course tried not to scare him or make sudden movements as we did not want to escalate the situation.  He stood up with the seatbelt on and started mumbling words in his language again.  At this time we were somewhat freaked out and did not know what to do so I had told them to stay with this guy til i called for help. I went to John Green's office just to confirm on what the procedure maybe if I should call Emergency Response and police.  After John had follwed me back to hangar 6 and assessed the situation we had called the police and ambulance.  This individual was not in the right state of mind.

2967,15-02-09 15:45,B 1900D,Aircraft Limitations Exceedance,,Occurrence,Inbound to CYEG (during test flight),Medium Risk,"Following completion of the airborne portion of a test flight on FNCL (for stall warning horn), the landing gear maximum extended speed (180 KIAS) was momentarily exceed by 10 knots (i.e., 190 KIAS).  This occurred as we were returning (from an area west of CYEG) to land at CYEG.  During the test flight in which approximately 20 stalls were performed as part of the maintenance release for a recent stall warning lift transducer vane replacement, we opted to leave the flaps in the 17-degree position and the landing gear down (where applicable), so as to avoid multiple unnecessary flap and landing gear extensions/retractions during the stalls.  This was thoroughly briefed between crew members in preparation for the stalls.\r\n\r\nFollowing completion of the stalls, as we were increasing speed for the return for landing at CYEG, we overlooked the fact that the flaps were still set at 17 degrees and the landing gear down.  I (Corey, PM) noticed this just as we were accelerating through approximately 183 KIAS.  I immediately retracted the flaps (so as to not exceed the maximum flap extended speed for 17 degrees of 188 KIAS), and simultaneously instructed Clement (PF) to pull power back to slow below 180 KIAS.  (The landing gear speed, however, had already been exceeded, and I felt it unprudent, for the momentary exceedance, to retract the landing gear at that time.)   The aircraft reached a maximum speed of 190 KIAS, and then quickly slowed below 180.  The balance of the return to CYEG for landing was uneventful.  Following arrival, the exceedance was entered as a defect in the aircraft journey logbook, with the specifics of the event discussed with maintenance.  Maintenance subsequently inspected the aircraft (noting no damage), and released the aircraft to service.\r\n\r\nNote: This report is being submitted with the understanding that the above event constitutes a CARs violation due to exceeding an AFM limitation.  The report is also being submitted two days post-event, due to time limitations associated with long duty days on Feb. 9th & 10th.\r\n\r\n~ C.

Stall test flights happen rarely (maybe once per year in entire 703/704 fleet), and although SOP's exist for stall recovery during normal flight operations (as practised at sim every year) there is no process for conducting repeated stalls as required by the test flight regime. \r\n\r\nAircraft ground schools have been have been updated to ensure this gear limitation is covered (it is a 1900 limitation, as well as high serial # King Airs). Aircraft SOP Bulletin has been issued for the 1900 to include this limitation in the Limitation section of the SOP.\r\n\r\nThis is a human factors error of the type Action Error - Lapse. Due to the frequent stalls (necessary for the stall warning horn calibration) the flight crew forgot to bring the gear and flaps up after the last stall.\r\n\r\nIn review, the impact to safety management and the likelihood of reoccurrence is determined to be low.  This investigation has been reviewed and determined to be managed to As Low As Reasonably Practical (ALARP), and meets the SMS requirements for a root cause analysis.  The cause has been determined to be a human error and unintentional deviation from a single standard, procedure or process.  The individuals were provided all appropriate training on these procedures, but failed to carry out the requirement of this single task.  My investigation has determined this decision was not affected by an external or environmental influence, which could have contributed to the decision made by the individuals.  This situation as reported has not occurred within the framework of recent guidance and the originator has self-reported this deviation to record the event and to allow the organization to review for any possible improvement(s).

Note:  if this is determined to be singe-point failure, requirement for RCA may be waived.\r\n\r\nDarren Cassel Fleet Specialist Feb 12, 15. \r\nAt request of QA Flight Ops some information on bleed air fail system.  A bleed fail is sensed by pressure loss in EVA tubing.  Ethylene Vinyl Acetate is a soft tubing that is plumbed along-side the engine bleed plumbing in the aircraft.  EVA tubing is built to melt at 204 degrees F.  18PSI pressure from the instrument air system is supplied to the EVA tubing.  If a engine bleed line fails or disconnects the hot engine air will melt EVA tubing dropping pressure in the tubing, once pressure drops to 2 PSI a pressure switch triggers the bleed fail annunciator light to alert the crew of bleed system issue.  \r\n\r\nThis EVA tubing is small and weak, and difficult to work with.  In this case a length of tubing in the LH wing leading edge pulled off of a splice and caused a leak and allowed annunciator to come on. Especially in cold conditions, EVA tubing will shrink enough that is can pull off splices and end fittings causing this issue.  As well if EVA tubing comes in to contact with structure or other aircraft components can chafe through quite easily.  It is a common issue King Air, 1900 and many Beechcraft aircraft use this type of system.  The EVA tubing is inspected on regular basis with the aircraft and unless the inspection is performed in extremely cold conditions it is almost impossible to detect this issue before it happens.   \r\n\r\nIn most cases this is a one of failure that requires just the right circumstances of cold temperatures, and movement of the aircraft.  There has been 5 instances of maintenance delays due to bleed fails since the beginning of 2014.  That is a high number, but there is very little we can do about it.  We will continue to be diligent during aircraft inspections to find issues before they happen.  \r\n\r\nRichelle Singer-SMS-February 13, 2015-1100L\r\nCADORs report attached and number added.\r\n\r\nFeb 17 2015\r\nDeborah Kominko Assistant Chief Pilot 703/704\r\nSpoke with both crew members.

The crew engaged MOC after departure and were given the option to return, and based on the information at hand, the crew elected to return to YYC.  The DFO and the PRM met the aircraft on arrival back in YYC and upon further investigation it was discovered that there were no technical indications (warning lights) that the gear doors were unsafe, however, the pictures taken in-flight did show the RH rear left gear door not entirely closed.  It was decided that the gear door was not a safety of flight issue and did not contravene any serviceability requirements for the continuation of flight and the flight subsequently departed.  Subsequently, on return the flight crew did snag the gear door rigging which although not unserviceable did appear to be require rectification by maintenance.  Maintenance completed minor rigging adjustments and the aircraft was then released to operations with not further issues related to the gear doors.\r\nThe Directors of Flight Operations and Maintenance have reviewed the event and believe that safety of flight was not compromised as a result of the actions of any of the flight operations or maintenance staff involved.\r\nAs a result of this air return the Flight Operations and Maintenance department have enacted the following standard procedures that will provide enhanced guidance to flight crews (memo attached).  This guidance reflects, if aircraft serviceability results in an air return, the flight crew must make an entry in the aircraft log book, and maintenance will perform the necessary maintenance actions to release the aircraft to flight.\r\nFrom operations experience the flight operations department has seen gear door rigging issues in the past that have not resulted in any cockpit indications.  Due to the nature of this event and the likelihood that it will repeat itself with the Dash 8 aircraft, training to flight crews now includes relevant information related to this and other events so they are aware that partially open gear doors can and occasionally does occur which do not affect serviceability but when discovered should be reported to maintenance.\r\n"

2976,15-02-23 0:15,737 All Types,Cabin/Passengers,Cabin Safety Procedures,Occurrence,NCA FBO,Medium Risk," Tammy was boarding our AC this evening and told me she was missing a pax so I went on board and informed the crew. They told me it looked like they had a full AC. I asked if they had actually counted and they said they were just about to count. I went back to talk to Tammy and she said the pax called in and said he'd be here in 10 min. I went back out to inform the crew and they once again said they had a full AC.I asked again if they had counted and they said yes. They marked down 78 pax in ZONE A and 80 pax in ZONE B for a total of 158. I came back inside and Tammy and I began to sort through the boarding passes I had collected on board to confirm who we were missing. Pax #84 Geriant Duffy was the only boarding pass we did not have and the only name we did not cross off of our manifest at the time of boarding, and that was the name of the passenger that called in saying he was 10 min away. While Tammy and I were sorting through passes, Flair closed their doors and fired up. We are convinced that the AC did not have 158 pax on board because we had taken no additional boarding passes above #158 and every person we had marked down on our second manifest for the RJ was boarded and crossed off so we had no pax left over in the building. Mr. Duffy did arrive close to 18:00 and he was denied the opportunity to switch his flight to the second AC due to his lack of concern for the promptness of his 17:00 departure.

2983,15-03-02 9:55,B 1900D,Traffic Conflict,Third Party Actions ,Occurrence,On arrival into Conklin (CET2),Medium Risk,"During our arrival into Conklin today, we experienced a traffic conflict with an outbound Sunwest aircraft.  Both aircraft had previously broadcasted their respective intentions on frequencies 122.8 (Local ATF) and 126.7 (Enroute), so there was no problem with communication.  The issue, however, occurred as we arrived over the waypoint MUVUD at 6500 feet ASL and proceeded eastbound to PEVTI for the GNSS approach onto Runway 27 (note, all as per our company arrival procedure).  The Sunwest aircraft departed Runway 27 and routed via OXAMU and MUVUD (again, just like our company departure procedure dictates), BUT climbed to and maintained 6000' ASL instead of a maximum altitude of 5500', as given in NCA's instructions.\r\n\r\nThe weather conditions were more-or-less IMC with broken cloud below us (while we were at 6500').  After the Sunwest aircraft reported crossing OXAMU and turning south-westbound toward MUVUD, I (Corey - PM in the right seat) attempted to contact them (on 126.7).  After a brief delay, they replied and I requested they level off at 5500' if possible, stating that we were at 6500'.  Unfortunately, they had already reached and levelled off at 6000'.  A few moments later, they reported sighting us visual (as they were approaching MUVUD and just after we had passed over and were turning eastbound from MUVUD).  A short time after this, Matt (PF in the left seat) gained visual contact with them as they passed a short distance behind us.  I, meanwhile, observed their position on TCAS at approximately 2.5 NM from us at an indicated altitude of only 400' below our altitude.  Had we been in complete IMC (i.e., in cloud without any visual contact between each other), this would have been all the more concerning.  (Note, no TCAS Traffic Alert occurred.)\r\n\r\nThis report is being submitted, in part, because I understand that Sunwest flight crews are currently NOT using the previously agreed upon altitudes that the two companies collaborated on one year or more ago.  Our occurrence today is, in my opinion, a prime example of the lack of vertical separation (i.e., less than a safety-critical minimum of 1000 feet) that can easily occur when two aircraft on roughly opposite direction tracks (one arriving, the other departing) use altitudes that only give approximately 500 feet of vertical separation.  (For reference, NCA last amended the procedures that it expects its flight crews to use in Ops Comm OC-ALL-14-04 in February of 2014.  See attached.  Note, it is my understanding that this procedure, including amendment to the altitudes to be used, was developed in collaboration with Sunwest.)\r\n\r\nAs a means of providing explanation about the above, the original procedure that was developed to address traffic conflict issues in and around Conklin, stipulated that aircraft arriving, as we did today, for Runway 27, must cross MUVUD and initially maintain 7000 while proceeding eastbound for the next waypoint, PEVTI, until no traffic conflict exists.  (Similarly, traffic departing Runway 27 would climb to no more than 6000'.)  It was quickly learned, however, that this was not a good idea, as such conflicted with instructions in the published instrument approach procedure, and meant that the aircraft (arriving via MUVUD and proceeding eastbound at 7000') would quickly enter restricted airspace (Cold Lake CYR 221).  For this reason, all of the company designed procedure altitudes associated with arriving at and departing from Conklin were dropped by 500 feet.  That is, 6000' became 5500', and 7000' became 6500'.\r\n\r\nBased on past experience since these altitudes were amended, the procedures work very well in serving to keep aircraft separated vertically by a minimum of 1000 feet.  When they are NOT used exactly as designed, a loss of adequate vertical separation can easily occur and, again in my opinion, this results in a risk to flight safety.\r\n\r\nSubmitted respectfully,\r\nCorey Young\r\nSMS Committee Flight Operations Employee Representative\r\n",Difference in altitudes used (for arriving at and departing from Conklin) between NCA pilots and those of Sunwest,"March 3 2015 838 L CYXJ\r\nVern Lace Q/A Manager maintenance\r\nNo maintenance action required\r\nFlight ops Q/A to determine risk\r\nAssigned to manager\r\n\r\nJames Wakulchyk QA Flt Ops Mar 3 2015  10:25 - risk med 2-3.

Cassandra.S marshalled the dash into the west boeing spot at approx. @1849. Dave.F grabbed an FA cart.  video was not active during the flight crew off load and was not clear enough to see if gear pins were installed or nose gear lock was engaged.  ODL was towed by Dave.F sometime after for swapping hangars.  Matt.B was sure the pins were installed and nose steering was engaged. Dave.F moved ODL into hangar #5 with Matt.B as the brake rider and Ron and Patrick both AMEs as wingwalkers.  later that evening ODL was needed to be moved back a few feet and that task was done by Russell, Dustyn, and Cass.
